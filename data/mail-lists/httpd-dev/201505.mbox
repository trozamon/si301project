A useful token could be status=OK|ERROR|MAINTENANCE where a backend
could advertise to the upstream load balancer that it may want to be put
in drain mode or something to that effect.
Since this list can't/won't be exhaustive of all things people could
care to send, let's add some head room in the spec by allowing
"custom-integer" and/or "custom-string". Otherwise, I suspect people
would cram things into the wrong fields just to get the data back to the
proxy.

I wonder what the practical applications could be for the "or more" case
- it seems like the intent is for different pools or resources to be
returned. If so, see below...

>

The backend MUST add the "X-Backend-Info" token to the "Connection" response header, making it a hop-by-hop field that is removed by the frontend from the downstream response (RFC2616 14.10 and RFC7230 6.1). [Note there appears to be an httpd bug here that I intend to submit and that needs to be addressed.]
>
>     Connection: X-Backend-Info

I'm not sure if this is a stroke of brilliance or extra work that isn't
needed :-) . As we discussed at the Con, it is vital for the proxy to
remove the header to avoid leaking any potentially useful information to
an attacker out to the 'tubes... but parsing Connection for
"X-Backend-Info" seems like it wouldn't be needed since one could just
as well check if X-Backend-Info header is present. I'm probably missing
the obvious, but can you help me understand more about why we would want
this here instead of treating the presence of the header as a sign to do
some kind of work?

>
> 5. The frontend parses the backend-info entries in the received "X-Backend-Info" response header. The values are then used as part of either an internal or an administrator-specified calculation to determine the load factor or weight of that node for subsequent requests.

Or taken as Gospel Truth and applied directly after some basic validate?

For this, I have created a module tentatively named mod_proxy_backend_info that does nothing except insert an output filter to populate the response header with version, provider, workers-*, request, uptime, and load-* values when the request header is present. Here is an example request-response:

Since the spec above states that one or more X-Backend-Info headers is
acceptable, there should be a way for the admin to declare upon which
header the calculation should be performed. A provider flag or option
(FIRST|LAST|"provider-name") ought to do the trick.

Side note: Is there a generic place for maths based on strings in httpd
at all? Creating our own mini-language makes me nervous since we have to
consider that backends can and will do stupid things that could result
in httpd attempting an operation that could cause a crash if we aren't
very careful about validating inputs and making sure we aren't doing
silly things like div/0

I will be happy to provide a ServletFilter that can be used in a J2EE
app or a Tomcat Valve (good for the many Tomcat variations and JBoss)
once we settle on details.

So modssl_ has been agreed on? :)
I'll go ahead. Thanks.

I believe SSL_X509_INFO_load_path() should be inlined into
its only caller. I'd like some eyes on this change since
it's not just mechanical.

The desired behaviour seems to be load as many certs as possible
from a directory, looping over its file entries. Ignore errors,
e.g. in case the file is not a cert. The replaced function returned
a boolean which was never checked.

Regarding the removed comment about merging the dir-read loop
with another one: I don't think that's worth it.

I would expect Location and LocationMatch using the same uri for 
comparison. I would actually go so far as the current state might 
warrant a CVE for being a hidden security risk that might cause 
inadvertent information exposure.

If someone really wants to have the "raw" uri for some reason I guess 
they can use <If> and a suitable expr?

Hmm, that assumption is wrong by definition. Location always matches a 
prefix (a part of a parsed/unparsed url), while LocationMatch always 
matches the complete URL.

It *is* documented right here, btw:

I'm +1 for this. The "Low-Level CA Certificate Loading" part in
ssl_util_ssl.c is / was only used by ssl_init_proxy_certs, so I would be
in favor of also moving SSL_X509_INFO_load_file to ssl_engine_init.c
(and making it static).

If we can get rid of code duplication on this occasion, then I think we
should do so - it makes future maintenance easier if there is common
code for loading CA files from a directory, be that for client
authentication (SSLCACertificatePath) or for proxy connections
(SSLProxyCACertificatePath).

Thanks for pushing ahead with the namespace cleanup, Stefan. I'm fine
with making the function static, but would suggest to rename it to
"asn1_string_to_utf8" instead - first, because it's really limited to
ASN.1 strings (doesn't deal with arbitrary ASN.1 data), and second,
because the "_to_" already implies a conversion (plus it matches the
naming of the other comparable functions in ssl_util_ssl.c).

Done: http://svn.apache.org/r1677339

I had minor reservations about using the asn1_ prefix since it is used
inside of OpenSSL (though not in public APIs) and it is used in public APIs
by GNU Libtasn1, used by GnuTLS. But it seems unnecessary to avoid a
clash with asn1_ because mod_ssl's is a static function and mod_ssl
won't compile with GnuTLS anyway.

I have a mod_dav fix that really ought to be in the next 2.4 release.  I'll get
it committed and nominated sometime this weekend.

Here's a situation that could go wrong if this new header weren't marked =

proxy topology, something like this:
user-agent =E2=86=90 httpd-proxy =E2=86=90 acme-proxy =E2=86=90 =
httpd-origin

(the server tiers might in fact be clusters of identically configured =
hosts).

All 4 tiers are doing HTTP/1.1 cacheing, correctly using Vary: and so =
on. If httpd-origin is sending X-Backend-Info then it must signal to =
ACME-proxy that this is a hop-by-hop header. Let's say httpd-origin =
signals that workers-free is 0. httpd-proxy receives a copy of this =
header and from acme-proxy. httpd-proxy incorrectly concludes that =
workers-free is 0 and starts sending 503 responses as per its intended =
configuration, even though acme-proxy would be able to serve stale =
responses from its cache.

The sysadmin contacts the vendor =E2=80=9CACME Proxy=E2=80=9D; the =
vendor asserts that their product is conforming to HTTP 1.1 and that the =
incorrect behaviour is in Apache httpd. Which, in my view, it would be.

We need to be careful on that phrasing. LocationMatch *can* match the =
complete URL if it is anchored at both ends. By default, though, it will =
match anywhere in the URL if it is unanchored, and it can (with the '/+' =
we are discussing here) behave just like Location and match a prefix if =
it is only anchored at the beginning.

Yay! I knew I had read it somewhere. Good find!

However, that documentation is actually not correct. This is not true: =
"For example, <LocationMatch \"^/abc\"> would match the request URL /abc =
but not the request URL //abc." Based on all of my tests, the leading =
slash *is* collapsed in the *Match and RewriteRule directives. =
Subsequent slashes after the first are not.

So, it is documented, but is there a compelling use case for this? When =
would someone actually need to match against the multiple slashes =
(unless it's some really strange hack someone has implemented)? The only =
thing I can think of is that maybe you want to force a redirect to =
remove multiple slashes, but couldn't a directive in mod_alias(?) maybe =
handle that if deemed necessary?

Also, yes it is documented, but when I brought it up at a hackathon =
table full of long-time committers at ApacheCon, no one knew about it, =
and I had to make an example. This says to me says that maybe it's =
unexpected behavior and a potential security risk as both Niklas and =
Ruggeri have suggested. That's why I brought it up in the first place.

And so the questions still remain: Right or wrong? Change it or leave =
it? Expected or unexpected? Security risk or user/configuration error?

The world may never know... ;-)

I may go ahead and write up a patch this weekend to change them all =
(*Match and RewriteRule) and then we can all debate it over on bugz too!

I=E2=80=99m Cc: this to dev@trafficserver.apache.org, since I think this =
is something some of our dev would be interested in. There are a few =
other replies to this thread already, which can be seen on the archives.

As has been mentioned in another reply, I think the header name ought to =
be something ^X- (see RFC 6648). Backend-Info or Backend-Capacity-Info =
or some such?

Cheers,

Other than a member being in error state, the balancer makes its =

While this is better than our current state of reactively marking =
members in error state based on failed requests, it still provides a =
limited view of the health/state of the backend.

Subject: Solving mutex concerns with OCSP stapling

Your thoughts on the following?

Current OCSP behavior that I think needs to be fixed:

mod_ssl holds the single stapling global mutex when looking up a cached
entry,
deserializing it, checking validity, and (when missing/expired)
communicating
with the OCSP responder to get a new response.

1. mod_ssl shouldn't hold the single stapling global mutex when talking to
   the OCSP responder.  This will stall ALL initial handshakes in all
stapling-
   enabled vhosts, regardless of the certificate they use.
2. For the cache itself, mod_ssl shouldn't hold the single stapling global
   mutex when looking up a cached entry unless the socache type requires it
   for its own purposes.  (memcached and distcache do not require it.)

Assumption: The cache can be shared among different httpd instances (e.g.,
via
memcached) but getting different instances to agree on which instance
refreshes
the cache is not worth handling for now.  (Let multiple instances refresh if
the timing is unlucky.)

What must be serialized globally within an httpd instance?

1. If the socache provider requires it: Any access to the stapling cache.
2. A thread claiming responsibility for refreshing the cached entry.

Why no global mutex per certificate?

1. There could be a large number of certificates, and lots of global mutexes
could be very surprising or even require OS tuning with some mutex types.
2. A single mutex is required to interact with the cache anyway (when the
cache requires a mutex).
3. That doesn't resolve the decision of which thread fetches a new response
anyway.

Solution A: Prefetching in a daemon process/thread per httpd instance

The request processing flow would be most unlikely to block for stapling
if a daemon is responsible for maintaining the cache and the request thread
never has to look anything up.  That leaves a race between prefetching the
first time and requests hitting the server right after server startup.
(Browsers may report an error to the user when tryLater is returned.)

The daemon would try to renew stapling responses ahead of the time that
the existing response could no longer be used.  If it can't, the error
path on the request thread would be the same as the current handling of
an inability to fetch a new response.

Solution B: Fetch on demand largely like current code, but utilize a
separate Fetch mutex

Hold the stapling cache mutex just while reading from/writing to the
cache; grab the Fetch mutex when needing to perform a lookup.
(Once obtaining the Fetch mutex, you'd need to look in the cache again
to see if another request thread did the lookup/store while waiting
for the Fetch mutex.)

By itself this doesn't solve potentially blocking a bunch of initial
handshakes when performing a lookup, but at least it solves blocking
requests that already have a cached response (different certificate)
when performing a lookup.

A fairly simple improvement to this would be to have a small number
of Fetch mutexes, where each certificate maps to a specific fetch
mutex (but not vice versa), so that lookups for multiple certificates
could be done at once.  This doesn't solve blocking all initial
handshakes for a certificate that needs a fresh response, or completely
solve blocking those for other certificates that need a fresh response
(since multiple certificates could map to the same Fetch mutex).

Solution C: Hybrid of A and B

The request thread implements solution B but generally a lookup on
the request thread won't be needed since the daemon has already done
the work.  But at server startup the daemon and the request threads
might fight over the Fetch mutex until responses for commonly-used
certificates had been obtained/cached.  This solves a potential lack
of responses at server startup.

Since the request thread is able to do the work in a pinch, this
lends itself to a "SSLStaplingPrefetch On|Off" directive that could
be used to disable the prefetch daemon.

ap_getparents() may be the right place to strip
(non-leading-)double-slashes, for any code using r->uri to be "fixed".

Well, yes, careful. It's actually the regex which is anchored, not the URL =

It's probably too old.

As said, I'd concur for fixing LocationMatch, but we might consider leaving=

as-is for RewriteRule (and document it better), because we may want to give=

the swiss-knife-user something to work on.

This new API is the inverse of an existing API, =
TSHttpTxnCacheLookupUrlGet(). It also works similar to another existing =
API, TSCacheUrlSet(). The main difference between this new API and =
TSCacheUrlSet() is that we work on normal URL objects. This can in some =
cases avoid unnecessary string conversion + string parsing -> URL that =
happens with TSCacheUrlSet().

This new API has the prototype

	TSReturnCode TSHttpTxnCacheLookupUrlSet(TSHttpTxn txnp, =
TSMBuffer bufp, TSMLoc obj);


The typical usage for this API is to modify the cache-key as used by the =
core. As such, it should work identical to TSCacheUrlSet(), except it =
avoids the string creation / parsing phase.


The related Jira is TS-3555. There is no ABI / API incompatibility here, =
since this is a new API. Docs =E2=80=9Cdiff=E2=80=9D is attached below.

None of this thread mentions /client/provided/./url, another issue.

The only 'wholesome' mechanism I can see to offer this would be an internal
redirect in all cases, where every module will study the same pattern.

The key issue I had with the lack of optional functions on the old NPN
backport is addressed, that's great.  Looks promising!

NPN is now irrelevant with ALPN, I presume?

Then add "safe" option (leaving "all" as is) and make "safe" default. safe
would point to known safe protocols at release time.


Is this a responsible recommendation, though?  Does TLSv1.0 offer any
significant improvement over SSLv3.0 that HTTP server project endorses?
Can or should 'we' officially designate SSLv3 as undesirable without
making the same recommendation for TLSv1.0?

It seems to me that SAFE at this time is TLSv1.2.

It also seems to me that the first problem to solve is to ensure if the use=
r
removes SSLv3 (+/- TLSv1.0) from their openssl installed binary, that we
simply respect that.  In that case, 'SSLProtocol all' should be just the
remaining supported TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols, or TLSv1.2-only.

And as I purge out all of my stale drafts - I notice this was brought up
again
w.r.t. POODLE.  I don't believe we want to alter the behavior of any config
that the user has deployed on a subrevision update (2.4.13 or 2.2.30, for
ex.)

We should propose solid new default configs, including the exclusion of bot=
h
SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0, and aim to default to TLSv1.2 only (ciphers and
protocols)
effective with 2.6 or 3.0, and by default on maintenance branches as of the
beginning
of the coming year.

FWIW, I agree.

There possibly should be ":!EXP" in both suites above.
Also I'd suggest removing RC4 from the latter suite, it is not
considered secure ([1]), and maybe replace it with "AES128-SHA256"
(both secure and fast with SNI).

Ideally, we probably should merge r1526168 and r1527291 from trunk.

     larger keys and support up to 8192-bit keys.  [Ruediger Pluem,
     Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: Improve handling of ephemeral DH and ECDH keys by
     allowing custom parameters to be configured via SSLCertificateFile,
     and by adding standardized DH parameters for 1024/2048/3072/4096 bits.
     Unless custom parameters are configured, the standardized parameters
     are applied based on the certificate's RSA/DSA key size. [Kaspar Brand]

  *) mod_ssl: drop support for export-grade ciphers with ephemeral RSA
     keys, and unconditionally disable aNULL, eNULL and EXP ciphers
     (not overridable via SSLCipherSuite). [Kaspar Brand]

or at least partly.

Beyond the (problematic?) requirement on OpenSSL 0.9.8a (discussed
below), and what may look like an improvement only (first one), there
are also security considerations:
- ephemeral DH keys (for EDH ciphers) are currently limited to 1024
bits in 2.2.x, so with 2048 bits or more certificates (quite
recommended today), one should use its own dhparams for (E)DH ciphers,
- ecparams loadable from certificate allow to configure the curve/key
(plus SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto() when openssl >= 1.0.2),
- export grade ciphers (removed from openssl's maintained versions)
are still in use with default/general configurations (FREAK, ...).

Regarding requirement on OpenSSL 0.9.8a (what's the actual requirement
in 2.2.x?), if that's really a stopper, it only concerns the use of
get_rfc{2409,3526}_prime_{1024,2048,..}() introduced in 0.9.8a
(AFAICT), and we could eventually include (statically) that primes in
the code for versions < 0.9.8a.
But is there real 2.2.x user with OpenSSL < 0.9.8a?

Also, those changes are effective since 2.4.7, and hence are quite
largely tested already.

Any pros/cons/comments before I try to resolve (hopefully) small conflicts?

I'm no expert (we use a proprietary toolkit and SSL module where I
spend most of my time), but that seems like quite an extreme thing to
preserve in 2.2.x.  Maybe worth a separate thread though to shake out
anyone with a stake in preserving it.

Subject: Possible mod_ssl's backports to 2.2.x? (was: Looking ahead to 2.4.13

I'd like to propose those 2.4.x CHANGES (r1542327+r1569005+r1542327)
for backport to 2.2.x (in reverse order):

  *) mod_ssl: Fix tmp DH parameter leak, adjust selection to prefer
     larger keys and support up to 8192-bit keys.  [Ruediger Pluem,
     Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: Improve handling of ephemeral DH and ECDH keys by
     allowing custom parameters to be configured via SSLCertificateFile,
     and by adding standardized DH parameters for 1024/2048/3072/4096 bits.
     Unless custom parameters are configured, the standardized parameters
     are applied based on the certificate's RSA/DSA key size. [Kaspar Brand]

  *) mod_ssl, configure: Require OpenSSL 0.9.8a or later. [Kaspar Brand]

  *) mod_ssl: drop support for export-grade ciphers with ephemeral RSA
     keys, and unconditionally disable aNULL, eNULL and EXP ciphers
     (not overridable via SSLCipherSuite). [Kaspar Brand]

or at least partly.

Beyond the (problematic?) requirement on OpenSSL 0.9.8a (discussed
below), and what may look like an improvement only (first one), there
are also security considerations:
- ephemeral DH keys (for EDH ciphers) are currently limited to 1024
bits in 2.2.x, so with 2048 bits or more certificates (quite
recommended today), one should use its own dhparams for (E)DH ciphers,
- ecparams loadable from certificate allow to configure the curve/key
(plus SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto() when openssl >= 1.0.2),
- export grade ciphers (removed from openssl's maintained versions)
are still in use with default/general configurations (FREAK, ...).

Regarding requirement on OpenSSL 0.9.8a (what's the actual requirement
in 2.2.x?), if that's really a stopper, it only concerns the use of
get_rfc{2409,3526}_prime_{1024,2048,..}() introduced in 0.9.8a
(AFAICT), and we could eventually include (statically) that primes in
the code for versions < 0.9.8a.
But is there real 2.2.x user with OpenSSL < 0.9.8a?

Also, those changes are effective since 2.4.7, and hence are quite
largely tested already.

Any pros/cons/comments before I try to resolve (hopefully) small conflicts?

Yann.

OK, as I said this is not so hard (at first glance) to avoid the use
of new functions for the backport.

Agreed, done with "Possible mod_ssl's backports to 2.2.x? (was:
Looking ahead to 2.4.13 / 2.2.30)".
Thanks.

Why?  To make it more wordy?  Strongly -1, this is why too many users get
their cipherlists wrong, they change one thing in an overly complex
expression already.  EXP is classified LOW, already excluded above.

openssl ciphers 'cipherlist'

with and optional -v arg will show you the resulting matchset of any
particular cipher list against the compiled-in ciphers.  Therefore...

openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!HIGH:!MEDIUM' | grep exp

Note that this was not an editorial commit, it was a scope change that was
buried hidden from the 2.4 commit log.  This simply brings 2.2 in line with
2.4 and trunk.

It's branded as less secure as things stand.  I'd be happy if we ripped
that example from all 2.2/2.4/trunk branches.

That said, if you want to retain it, do you have benchmarks to point us at?

Happy to consider such a proposal.

Agreed.  Wouldn't a ./configure time warning suffice?

I also disagree with disabling 0.9.7 entirely on a legacy branch.

Was hoping for md4 vs. aes128 comparisons, (and AES-NI isn't everywhere,
but will be, soon enough).

While I agree md4 is less desirable, if we were going to make a
recommendation,
I'd go with favoring aes128 over md4 but retain md4 as a backup, in forced
server
preference.  And label this a known-insecure configuration.

Do you mean RC4?  I think the conventional wisdom (of the moment) is
to remove RC4 completely.

Yes - sorry.  I suggest we remove the 'optimized' example altogether, and
will go ahead with that if nobody objects.  We obviously don't keep up.  I
will also duplicate the SSLCipherList to SSLProxyCipherList (all examples
are now in global scope).

I propose we replace the 'optimized' example with the following;

#  Effective 2017, only TLSv1.2 ciphers should be in use.
#  Older ciphers should be disallowed as soon as possible, however
#  much older clients such as IE6 SP2 on XP may still be in use.
#  Replace the SSLCipherSuite and SSLProxyCipherSuite directives
#  above with these directives to restrict mod_ssl to TLSv1.2 ciphers
#  as soon as this is practical.
# SSLCipherSuite TLSv1.2:!eNULL
# SSLProxyCipherSuite TLSv1.2:!eNULL

Thoughts?

I haven't used apache 2.2, but isn't OCSP stapling support still
missing there?

I think if you're already working on backporting important TLS features
that should certainly go with them.

My own line for 2.2 would be drawn somewhere between Yann's proposal
and things like OCSP stapling.   I think the former is more
fundamental/hardening and a better fit for the aging release.

We are deliberately not that disruptive to users.  Our goal is to push more
secure code at users, but not at the risk of their electing to not update,
due to such blunt force.  A subversion update should never break a working
installation.

A few comments (mainly on the proposal to piggy-back the load info header i=
n the responses) :
*) The mechanism may not work in certain setups of the SLB (e.g DSR)*) For =
TLS, I presume this proposal assumes that the connections are terminated at=
 the SLB layer?*) How does the proposal apply to newer protocols like SPDY,=
 HTTP/2? (or) the request/responses are streams within a connection, and AF=
AIK, headers like Connection/Keep-Alive are no longer valid with SPDY (and =
perhaps, even with HTTP/2)
Thanks,

 I=E2=80=99m Cc: this to dev@trafficserver.apache.org, since I think this i=

As has been mentioned in another reply, I think the header name ought to be=
 something ^X- (see RFC 6648). Backend-Info or Backend-Capacity-Info or som=

>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 X-Backend-Info: version=3D1.0
>=20
> 2. The backend node receives a request with an "X-Backend-Info" header sp=
ecifying a version it supports.

> 3. A supporting backend node SHOULD insert one or more "X-Backend-Info" r=
esponse headers with any subset of the backend-info fields that it supports=
, including the required "version" field. The version of information provid=
ed MUST be less than or equal to the version requested. (The fields are sta=
ndardized so that various frontends know what to expect, rather than each b=
ackend system/server/service/app creating its own fields/values.) E.g.:
>=20
>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 X-Backend-Info: version=3D1.0, provider=3D"Backend X", worke=

sponse header, making it a hop-by-hop field that is removed by the frontend=
 from the downstream response (RFC2616 14.10 and RFC7230 6.1). [Note there =
appears to be an httpd bug here that I intend to submit and that needs to b=
e addressed.]

 or weight of that node for subsequent requests.

e this:<br clear=3D"none">&gt; <br clear=3D"none">&gt; 1. The frontend (per=

normal proxied request or (2) a dedicated health check adds an "X-Backend-I=
nfo" request header to a backend request, informing the backend that it wan=

&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; X-Backend-Info: version=3D1.0<br clear=3D"none">&gt; <br =
clear=3D"none">&gt; 2. The backend node receives a request with an "X-Backe=
nd-Info" header specifying a version it supports.<br clear=3D"none">&gt; <b=
r clear=3D"none">&gt; 3. A supporting backend node SHOULD insert one or mor=
e "X-Backend-Info" response headers with any subset of the backend-info fie=
lds that it supports, including the required "version" field. The version o=
f information provided MUST be less than or equal to the version requested.=
 (The fields are standardized so that various frontends know what to expect=
, rather than each backend system/server/service/app creating its own field=
s/values.) E.g.:<br clear=3D"none">&gt; <br clear=3D"none">&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp=

p; &nbsp; &nbsp; requests=3D85939<br clear=3D"none">&gt; <br clear=3D"none"=
>&gt; 4. The backend MUST add the "X-Backend-Info" token to the "Connection=
" response header, making it a hop-by-hop field that is removed by the fron=
tend from the downstream response (RFC2616 14.10 and RFC7230 6.1). [Note th=
ere appears to be an httpd bug here that I intend to submit and that needs =
to be addressed.]<br clear=3D"none">&gt; <br clear=3D"none">&gt;&nbsp; &nbs=

; 5. The frontend parses the backend-info entries in the received "X-Backen=

 or weight of that node for subsequent requests.<br clear=3D"none">&gt; <br=

tation, this has two pieces. The first is when httpd is used as a backend n=

Here is my proposed global config for httpd.conf.in for 2.4 and 2.2, which
I believe mirrors the 'MUST' of RFC 7525. This includes restoring the
SSLProtocol -SSLv3 for 2.4 so that it is plainly visible, irrespective of
system defaults.

For trunk, I propose we drop TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols and simply adopt
the recommended cipher list illustrated below (!SSLv3) in the default
extra/httpd-ssl.conf source, following the SHOULD recommendations.

Comments?

#   SSL Cipher Suite:
#   List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
#   See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!MD5:!RC4
SSLProxyCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!MD5:!RC4

#  Effective 2017, only TLSv1.2 ciphers should be in use.
#  Older ciphers should be disallowed as soon as possible, however
#  much older clients (such as IE6 SP2 on XP) may still be in use.
#  Replace the SSLCipherSuite and SSLProxyCipherSuite directives
#  above with these directives to restrict mod_ssl to TLSv1.2 ciphers
#  as soon as practical.
# SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!SSLv3
# SSLProxyCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!SSLv3

#   As user agents such as web browsers are not configured for the user's
#   own preference of either security or performance, and in every case
#   this should be the prerogative of the web server administrator who must
#   manage cpu load, enforce server's preferred cipher order.

#   SSL Protocol support:
#   List the protocol versions which clients are allowed to connect with.
#   Disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 by default (cf. RFC 7525 3.1.1).  TLSv1 (1.0)
#   should be disabled as quickly as practical.  By 2017, only the TLSv1.2
#   protocol or later should remain in use.

(oops - saw this sitting int he outbox for the past week - sorry for
slow reply)

These were the notes I took. I was going to start biting them off after
I wrapped up splitting/editing the recordings from the ACNA talks:
*Ensuring all stats showed up on the page (I don't recall if any stuck
out that were missing)
*Add ability to reset the stats captured
*Set or adjust min/max for the connection pooling
*Send what httpd thinks the worker status is (useful for backends that
would like to know about drain, etc) to the backend in a header

FWIW I'm just testing solution B for the moment.  I think that the 
ability to prefetch is needed for the busiest sites to avoid weird 
pileups, but B seems necessary anyway.

Since we are told, every time the discussion of abandoning 2.2.x comes
up, that too many distro's with LTS's and Enterprise versions still
support and maintain these antique versions, many admins do also require
those antique distro versions but elect to build current source of

Noel, that is precisely the purpose of trunk, always.  The 'next' release.
Might be 2.6, might be called 3.0.

We cherry pick fixes to backport all the time, but trunk exists to shape
the subsequent release.

Which is where you should direct your attention to backport proposals, on
2.4 as well as 2.2, since these are now adopted by users.

And if you pay particularly close attention, you'll note that trunk already
presents itself as 2.5.0-dev, its version number when we first attempt an
alpha toward 2.6 or 3.0, sometime is the future.

I forgot to mention that this might potentially break some clients
(Java 7 and earlier only?), as noted in the docs/faq changes.
These expect 1024 bits DH params prime lengths whatever the
certificate's modulus' length is...
Should we have a special (2.2.x only?) directive to help mitigate the
possible regression (e.g. to force 1024 primes max only, default?), or
is the documented workaround enough (i.e. add dhparams in the
configured SSLCertificateFile)?

BTW, I proposed [1] for backport in r1678107, having tested the patch
successfully for [E[C]]DH, with certificates (modulus) >= 1024 bits,
and OpenSSL versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.8o, 1.0.1m and 1.0.2a.

>From my perspective - as a simple packager (re: openssl - old versions) I
run into the problem of only being able to get to 0.9.8.k (AIX 5.3 TL12).
With AIX 6.1 and 7.1 it would be openssl-1.0.0(something - do not know by
memory what patchlevel IBM openssl.base is at). Personally, I am going to
look at packaging against LibreSSL. There are only three #ifdefs I needed
to add to get it to build. My apologies for being so late with saying
anything about this (I have been busy with 'regular' work.

I will start a new thread later today - and do it again from trunks of
2.2.x, 2.4.x and 2.5.x.

In short, there are ways around dependencies on old versions of openssl on
AIX. And further, if a 'user' is not willing to upgrade their OpenSSL - why
would you think they are going to upgrade to the latest httpd-2.2.x (or any
version for that matter).

The rules change - and we (read "me and other users") cannot reasonably
claim "latest and greatest from ASF" while requiring support for insecure
openssl. IMHO - you, ASF, also have an implied responsibility to the users
of Apache httpd powered sites. Being backward compatible too long keeps
weaknesses alive.

Michael

p.s. - for what is is worth +1 to drop 0.9.7 (maybe even 0.9.8 - but must
test more)

Hi,

The SO_REUSEPORT patch has been in trunk for a few months now and has 
been proposed for backport in 2.4.x.

Here is an interesting paper which gives a clear explanation and some 
benchmark results:
http://www.intel.ie/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/scaling-apache-server-performance-paper.pdf


Would be great if it could be committed in 2.4.x.
Having it reviewed and tested for 2.4.13 may not be possible because of 
the T&R window which seems to be in the coming days/weeks.
(this already what was answered for the 2.4.11/2.4.12 release)


Maybe, 2.4.14 could focus on reviewing/merging this patch and associated 
performance improvement?
To help adoption, maybe an ASF server could be upgraded with a 
SO_REUSEPORT patched version of Apache to have our own measurements and 
see how it scales in a real world application.
This has already been done in the past (testing impact of the skiplist 
implementation).

Best regards,
CJ

I did some testing with an injector at the time of the proposal (on a
2.2.x version of the patch, so mainly with worker), and can confirm
that it really scales much better.
Where httpd without SO_REUSEPORT stops accepting/handling connections,
it continues to shine with the option/buckets enabled.
(I don't have the numbers for now, need to search deeper, btw the ones
from Intel are probably more of interest...)

So regarding the upgrade on infra, the difference may not be obvious
if the tested machine is not "at the limits".

One thing that probably is worth testing is (graceful) restarts, though.

Regards,
Yann.

Therefore we ensure everyone who would otherwise pick up security fixes in
the future will refuse to do so, because we stubbornly force a
breaking/incompatible behavior change on some subversion legacy
maintainence bump?  And yourself, a packager, shipping new packages for an
operating system with vulnerabilities which are no longer being patched?
 check...

I've proposed changing the *default* config, universally, across all
shipping versions.  Yann proposes to enhance mod_ssl in non-breaking ways
even back to 2.2, because 75-80% of the deployed servers have yet to update
to 2.4.  Not that most won't eventually, but right now, they are at 2.2.

About users who have deployed a server, you can rant about employing the
cudgel to the foolish administrators' skulls who won't re-configure their
systems, however that is not an effective tool to ensure users update to
the least-buggy, least-insecure subversion release of the software.  It was
mentioned in another thread, but just as an example, ripping out SSLv3
essentially means that every user with older back-end services will *never*
update again, period.  Is that a rational act by an upstream project?

When discussing 2.2 and 2.4, altering the behavior of an update is not in
scope.  Upgrades are a multi-layered project which require other systems to
be rolled out first, in waves.  In the case of back end applications, you
have a redevelopment cycle where you are adapting to the latest
Java/Python/PHP/whatever before the back end service can be updated to a
hosting framework which supports TLSv1.2 properly.

Altering the behavior of the next upgrade, 2.5.0-dev (trunk) is absolutely
in scope, and knowing it will be quite a while before that sees a General
Availability release, it makes the most sense to be forward-looking and
anticipate the state of TLS that much further down the road.  That can
include ripping out SSLv3 and TLSv1.0.

I never assume it is easy. As far as AIX goes, it would be "easier" for me,
as a packager to ignore AIX 5.3. But, for now, what I package for AIX 5.3
(TL7 and later) also works on AIX 6.1 and AIX 7.1 - unchanged.

Getting people to update is hard. Some do it automatically - proud to be
bleading edge, some never update regardless of argument.

I would hope that by changing any requisites (e.g., minimal level of
openssl) would not change the behavior of the application. If it does, then
I would tend to follow (what I think you are saying) - that such a change
is not permitted. In that case, hurrying a new release where it is
applicable (e.g., 2.6.X) might be sensible - if a factor such as security
is the driving (emotional) motivator.

What was I thinking? Well, little me was considering the recent "media"
storms re: web-related security (when they mean the servers that browsers
connect to) - and what an organization (perhaps community is a better word)
could do to assist from the server side - rather than placing ALL the
responsibility and load on the remote device (phone, tablet, desktop).

So, yes - it it "breaks" the server by raising the bar as far as XXX is
concerned, we cannot, or maybe should not, raise that bar for those
releases with an "improved" XXX.

As far as OpenSSL goes - maybe the only affected component is mod_ssl. I am
probably completely offbase (I like simple worldviews when I can get away
with it) - but I thought OpenSSL is an API. I would hope the API for 0.9.7
and 0.9.8 are compatible; while openssl-1.0.0 and OpenSSL-0.9.X are not.
And again, that is only an issue if something in the new API is definitely
needed. If not, something like mod_ssl might still link against
OpenSSL-0.9.8 - but, as far as ASF httpd and mod_ssl is concerned -
security concerns with the root cause in openssl-0.9.8 are not supported.

Please excuse my rambling: too many phone calls in between.

In short, if it does not impact the expected behavior of httpd I would hope
that dropping "support" for openssl-0.9.X will improve "the product" and be
a motivator for upgrading, rather than a limiting factor. (Oh how I love my
pink glasses :) )

yes, I had a bad (few) day then - flu 

Either way, using slackware on all my servers its trivial since the
distro keeps pretty much up to date by design - unlike RH/debian and
their kiddy versions who bring out new releases with 2+yo libs and other
goodies, I'd just hesitate to drop them, wait and see whats capable in
their current enterprise releases when the time comes to make that
decision, since RH is most used enterprise release, I'm going to
contradict myself here - since it's always been my belief that upstreams
should never base their decisions on downstreams (like ASF does WRT
deprecating 2.2) but if RH for example's new release at the time doesn't
support 1.2, its pointless dropping 1.0/1.1 

Dont get me wrong, I think RH, debian, and to a point even SUSE, are the
ones who need to pull their finger out and modernise (been 10 years
since I touched/looked at a BSD box so wont comment on the state of
them) 

But... maybe... you are right... making the statement now that come 2.6
(I'd rather see it in a new major - like 3.x) that if those guys cant
get their act together by then, they got nobody to blame but themselves.

Redhat already supports 1.2, not only thew new RHEL7, also up-to-date=20
RHEL6, only RHEL5 which is still supported is behind and that's just=20
because that's the whole purpose of a LTS distribution

Currently, three Debian releases are still supported:

 - Debian Jessie (current stable)
     * released 2015-04
           - main support will end 2018-05
           - possibly LTS until 2020-04
     * ships Apache 2.4.10
     * ships OpenSSL 1.0.1k + patches
     * supports TLS v1.2 chipers

 - Debian Wheezy ("oldstable")
     * release 2013-05
           - main support will end 2016-02
           - probably LTS until 2018-05
     * ships Apache 2.2.22 + patches
     * ships OpenSSL 1.0.1e + patches
     * supports TLS v1.2 chipers

 - Debian Squeeze ("oldoldstable")
     * release 2011-02
     * only x86 architectures still supported ("long term support", LTS)
       and there not all packages (but Apache and OpenSSL still are)
           - LTS will end 2016-02
     * ships Apache 2.2.16 + patches
     * ships OpenSSL 0.9.8o + patches
     * only supports SSLv3 chipers (esp. no SHA2 family hashes)

Note that Debian Jessie's Apache default configuration already comes with:

SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL
SSLProtocol all -SSLv3

Here is the corresponding patch (attached).

I chose to define a new proxy_http_req_t struct which is passed to
each mod_proxy_http (static) functions (to avoid yet more args), and
then declared local vars with the same name as the old parameters (to
limit code change and ease review).
I would use (some of) the req fields directly in the commit (if
acceptable), because it's not always necessary...

Comments?

The fix mentioned there is about APR's dbd (mysql) code but has never
been pushed to a release (the bugzilla report is still open).
As already discussed in [1] (with a simililar fix for mod_authn_dbd in
[2]), I don't think it should be addressed in APR though (but in httpd
as you and the OP of bugzilla #46421 proposed).

There also seems to be other misuses of apr_dbd_get_entry() returned
values in httpd, I'll start a thread on the dev@ mailing-list and
propose a fix.

[1] http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@apr.apache.org/msg26024.html
[2] http://svn.apache.org/r1663647

---------- End of forwarded message ----------

The issue is that apr_dbd_get_row()'s entries (usually pointed to by
apr_dbd_get_entry(), depending on dbd though) get destroyed whenever
apr_dbd_get_row() returns -1 (no more rows in iterative mode).

This seem to be the case for several dbd systems implemented in APR,
so I think we should take care of the entries' lifetime when used
after an apr_dbd_get_row() loop.
Thus, I think the attached patch should be applied, thoughts?

PS: there are also APR dbd systems where the entries are duplicated on
the apr_dbd_results' pool, so APR is not really consistent...

r1679032 implements Plan B, without using multiple Fetch mutexes.

Some further thoughts:

Alternative to Plan A for prefetching: A request thread realizes that 
stapling response will expire "soon", claims responsibility for 
refreshing it so that other request threads don't do so, and does the 
work; this avoids another execution thread to perform the prefetch.  
Somehow claiming responsibility seems like it will add its own 
complication (need stapling cache entry type at front of cert-based 
cache key, and one type is response and another type is refresh 
responsibility???).  r1679032 would still be used when this isn't done, 
such as when there isn't demand in time (e.g., mass vhosting, for some 
value of "mass").

Plan A could presumably use some "mod_daemon" or similar that lets 
modules off-load non-request-related work to a separate child process 
(or thread on Windows).  mod_ssl_ct is an existing module its own 
service work daemon.  It doesn't seem so useful to keep adding more and 
more ;)

Subject: silly ab patch for SNI and OCSP stapling
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

... where "OCSP stapling" means "get the server to do the related work 
but don't care what you get back".

Perhaps this doesn't save any time for anybody that would want to test 
such a thing, but who knows?

The lack of SNI is a pretty big hole now; it probably doesn't need much

At the moment I very slightly prefer seeing the reminder that there 
isn't always a mutex, but I won't care before long.  I prefer that this 
matches the implementation of the session cache mutex on where the 
socache flag is checked, but if it makes you happy and you change the 
session cache equivalent to match then go for it :)

Nope, I have no strong opinion either, let's keep it as is, that makes sense.

Here we simply drop RC4 as mentioned in RFC7525 (a MUST NOT), and extend
the default list out to the proxy client behavior.

The defaults for httpd-2.2 rely on ylavic's proposed 'mod_ssl: Improve
handling of ephemeral DH and ECDH keys'... backport which addresses eNULL,
 aNULL and EXP in an unambiguous way.

This is, as we discussed, simply eliminating the speed-optimized
suggestions, let the user look elsewhere for [frequently updated] guidance.

I used the !SSLv3 logic rather than explicitly calling out TLSv1.2 so we
enjoy a better transition to TLSv1.3+.

Since the proposal to suggest !kRSA is new, it deserves a brief word of
explanation.  RSA cipher negotiation remains valid.  But signed RSA
certificates must be exchanged using the ECDHE or ECDH in order to provide
forward secrecy.  This was proposed by Mark Thomas after evaluating how the
Qualys SSL test behaved, resulting in upgrading from an A- to an A (where
he enabled only HIGH grade ciphers and omitted MEDIUM).  It is interesting
that this wasn't part of their Dec '14 v1.4 guidance whitepaper, but I'm
sure it will be clarified in future revisions.  Only IE8 on XP is called
out as requiring Kx=RSA with TLSv1.2 by default.

in httpd-2.2, we may also wish to explicitly disable SSLv2 - notably for
3DES ciphers, but at the moment this is accomplished with !EXP:!kRSA (and
by not including LOW grade ciphers).  Just thinking that if the user
enables kRSA they also may inadvertently re-allow 3DES which has only 112
effective bits of key strength, not the 168 claimed.

This also relies on guidance from RFC7525

The httpd 2.2 proposal already committed drops SSLv2 as well.

I am all on board to now start ripping SSLv3 protocol and default
to only TLSv1.2 ciphers, on trunk, once this config backport has been
reviewed and committed.

Looks good to me, thanks!

I committed r1679470 in trunk and proposed a backport to 2.4.x (will
propose a v2 for my 2.2.x patch which is also concerned), since
SSL_DEFAULT_CIPHER_LIST (default when no SSL[Proxy]CipherSuite is
configured) does not include "!aNULL:!eNULL" for older OpenSSL
versions (though still supported).

This breaks autoindex generated Indexes!
This really should be reverted and rethunk.

I have a testfile and header/readme files in all subdirectories below=20
/htdocs
There is an index.html file in /htdocs
I have no FallbackResource configured.

DocumentRoot /htdocs
DirectoryIndex index.html
Options Indexes Includes FollowSymlinks
AllowOverride AuthConfig Indexes

/htdocs
/htdocs/subdir [1]
/htdocs/subdir/subsub1 [2]
/htdocs/subdir/subsub2
/htdocs/subdir/subsubN

[1] header/readme files are ignored, testfile shows in index but=20
selecting it gives 404
[2] all these subsub directories return 404

Adding DirectoryIndex disabled at /htdocs/subdir/.htaccess doesn't fix it=
=2E

If I remove the index.html file from /htdocs, all works as it should,=20
but this is not how it has been.
If I Alias /subdir, all works as it should also even with index.html in=20
/htdocs.

Regards,

Gregg

We are very close... I believe wrowe has some somewhat trivial
reservations about it, but we are awaiting 1 more vote.

Someone want to address wrowes concerns on trunk and patch
the patch (stuff like naming)? I may have time next week.

My chief concern was that the phrase "Common Log" has a specific meaning to
us.

ap_mpm_common_log_startup() or something else descriptive would be a better
name, but our crew is famous for not being terrific namers of things :)

Did this compile with no warnings?  It seems statics were used without
being explicitly initialized, and I don't have my copy of K&R to check that
these are always NULL, but guessing that's so.   For clarity alone, I'd
prefer these were initialized like every other example they were adjacent
to.

Good afternoon,

As some of you may be aware, cPanel is a leader in the hosting industry =
as we provide software that allows end users to easily run a server and =
associated LAMP stack.  Yesterday, May 14th, we changed the default =
installation target to Apache 2.4 over Apache 2.2.

Currently, around 80% of our user base uses Apache 2.2.  I=E2=80=99m =
hoping to have those customers using Apache 2.4 in the next year.

I know that you guys like to keep track of 2.2 vs 2.4 usage, so =
hopefully we=E2=80=99ll start noticing the 2.4 usage increase gradually =
over the next year or so.

Thanks for your time!

It definitely blocks autoindex which I think means it has to go, but
for me only when you actually use a fallbackresource.  I am still not
understannding the other scenario outlined where no fallbackresource
at all changes the behavior of accessing a static file.

I'm not sure FallbackResouce has anything to do with it actually, even 
though the commit to fix FallbackResource not working properly is what 
broke this. Sorry for the long ramble but here goes.

What it is doing is dropping the preceding /path/ when there are more 
than one folder in past the configured DocumentRoot. It it's only 
happening when the URL plugged into the browser is to a directory, not a 
file and does not contain a trailing /. It's hard to describe, I've only 
since noticed the trailing slash as part of the equation and it's got 
odd secondary behaviors.

I suppose screencaps are worth a throusand words.

The directory tree tested with, c:\Apache24T\htdocs is the configured 
DocumentRoot for localhost.
http://people.apache.org/~gsmith/r1677186/directorytree.png

Now, if I go to http://localhost/foo, what I see is this;
http://people.apache.org/~gsmith/r1677186/ffmouseovr.png

You will notice that first, the header.html and readme.html contents are 
not showing up, this is what first caught my attention. Also notice what 
is in the address bar of Firefox and what mousing over a link shows in 
the bottom left. The link for what should be http://localhost/foo/bar1 
is is instead generated as http://localhost/bar1, missing the /foo in 
it. Likewise, if I moused over what should be 
http://localhost/foo/testfile.txt what I see in the mouseover is 
http://localhost/testfile.txt. Again, missing /foo.

Oddly however, if I type in the address http://localhost/foo/bar3, the 
header and readme files show, yet the same thing happens to the links 
being generated. Only this time it is missing the /bar3 when I hold the 
mouse over the baz folder.
http://people.apache.org/~gsmith/r1677186/ffmouseovr2.png

Now prior to r1677186, if I plugged http://localhost/foo/bar1 into my 
browser httpd would redirect me to the same URL with the trailing slash 
added, like what will happen if you click this link
http://people.apache.org/~gsmith/r1677186

This behavior seems to be what has been broken, my browser is not 
redirected to the URL + trailing /. If I type into my browser 
http://localhost/foo/ and include that trailing slash, all works as 
should as well.

The generated links are somehow being corrupted and at least in the 
first folder in (foo), the readme and header is not showing.

But there's more odd behavior. To add further confusion, I just decided 
to drop an index.html file in foo and go to http://localhost/foo 
(without the trailing slash), I get the directory listing, no 
header/readme, and I can see index.html in the listing which the 
mouseover shows as http://localhost/index.html, again, missing the /foo 
in the generated link. index.html IS configured as a DirectoryIndex and 
it should be showing instead of the index listing.

So going to "http://www.brandname.com/contestrules" as is printed on my 
cereal box without a trailing slash, would be broken too.

s/ap_log_common/ap_log_mpm_common/ in r1679714 and added to backport proposal.

Regarding globals/statics explicit initializations (implicit
initialization to {0} is required by the C standard), I don't think it
is necessary/suitable since and it may move these variables from the
.bss to the .data section, the former being quicker to initialize (as
a whole) at load time (though explicit initializations to {0} usually
go to .bss too but it depends on the compiler and/or flags, and we
don't explicitely need .data for those).
So I did not change the code wrt this...

Good afternoon,

As some of you may be aware, cPanel is a leader in the hosting industry as=

Currently, around 80% of our user base uses Apache 2=2E2=2E  I=E2=80=99m h=

I know that you guys like to keep track of 2=2E2 vs 2=2E4 usage, so hopefu=

I use vi too:
:help
!}fmt 76
:se ai
:se noai
:se list
:se nolist

PS Caution: fmt on FreeBSD is (or was) not 8 bit clean.
http://berklix.com/~jhs/src/bsd/fixes/FreeBSD/src/gen/usr.bin/fmt/

Some of the vi clones do more formatting & colour highlighting & syntax/ bracket matching
(while fine for Reading code, the colour flashing drives one mad adding new code)
I forgot the name 'vim' but found again via
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=vi&stype=all&sektion=editors

I just noticed
http://berklix.com/~jhs/src/bsd/jhs/bin/public/tab/
does not take pipes (so forget that with !} ). Oh well, I'm too busy !

http://berklix.com/~jhs/src/bsd/jhs/bin/public/brackets/

'tidy' for html of course
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/

My WYSIWYG hooks for tying nvi into ghostview, chimera etc for
.ps & .pdf & .html viewers (so one can hack txt with vi & auto format 
& redisplay each ':w' ) - no reason one couldnt extend such a trick to C )

in that case shouldn't you also be overriding Host:, so the SNI host name
can use the same override?  I think this may lead the user into a more
helpful scenario, if indeed they don't already know when to override Host:,
and I don't know how useful it is to have different values for Host: and
SNI.

Yep, my mistake. I thought there was a command line switch to change the
host header. You're correct - it wouldn't make much sense to override
one and not the other.

(Coming back to this).

The error buckets are metadata buckets, and they are inserted before the =
EOS in the stream. Buckets are processed in order, for there to be a =
response splitting problem the error bucket will need to appear after =
the EOS.

In the case of mod_deflate=E2=80=99s input filter, it does not seem to =
take any notice of an error bucket (or any meta buckets), and so is =
likely to silently consume the error bucket (which is of zero length).

I suspect previously the core was silently swallowing errors, and now =
that this is fixed mod_deflate is now silently swallowing errors. It =
looks like mod_deflate needs to be fixed, but it doesn=E2=80=99t affect =
the underlying patch (from what I can see).

Graham

Hello,

Mod_lua gave me a few quick wins when I started to play around
with cookies on a reverse proxy. But then the obvious happened:
the backend started to issue multiple Set-Cookie response headers
in the same http response.

mod_lua returns the headers via r.headers_out, but while the
documentation states the return value is of lua-type "table",
it is actually of lua-type "userdata" and I can not seem my way
around accessing more then a single Set-Cookie header per
request. The latter is done via r.headers_out['Set-Cookie'],
but now I got stuck.

Any ideas?

Best,

Christian Folini

This should really go to users@, but anyway...
You might want to take a look at:

http://modlua.org/api/builtin#setcookie

With regards,

Daniel,

Thank you for your swift response.

It seems I did not make myself clear and made it look like this
is a users@ question, but I think it is not.

I am not developing an application. I have the application and I
am now using mod_lua on the reverse proxy in front of the
application.

So I am running a LuaOutputFilter and want to access the
Set-Cookie headers in the response, which has been created
by the application on the backend.

lua getcookie is based on ap_cookie_read, which reads the
Cookie request header. But I need to read the Set-Cookie
response headers. All of them. And r.headers_out is only
giving me the one of them, while the application issued
multiple Cookies in multiple Set-Cookie headers.

Any hint is still appreciated, but I really doubt users@
could help me. It's a special case not covered by the 
mod_lua documentation, AFAIK.

Best,

Christian

Thanks.

Subject: new mod_ssl environment variable SSL_{CLIENT|SERVER}_EXT_KEYUSAGE_purpose
From: Ghetolay <ghetolay@gmail.com>
To: dev@httpd.apache.org
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=90e6ba61468830979c051680270a

--90e6ba61468830979c051680270a
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hi,

I've created a new environment variable in order to test for an extended
key usage into a certificate. Like clientAuth on a client certificate
authentication for instance. This variable can then be used on a Require
directive as follow :

Require expr %{SSL_CLIENT_EXT_KEYUSAGE_clientAuth} == "true"

Format of the variable name is as follow :

SSL_{CLIENT|SERVER}_EXT_KEYUSAGE_purpose

Where purpose is either a shortname ( serverAuth, clientAuth etc...) or an
oid. Shortname are case insensitive and '.' on oid must be replace with '_'.
Here is some valid examples :

SSL_CLIENT_EXT_KEYUSAGE_clientAuth
SSL_SERVER_EXT_KEYUSAGE_SERVERAUTH
SSL_CLIENT_EXT_KEYUSAGE_1_3_6_1_5_5_7_3_2

You can check on the code here
<https://github.com/ghetolay/httpd/commit/7b5cde756ff965160313039fb83605724bae38cf>
.
We may improve the comparison of oid by checking each number one by one
instead of converting both *var* (replace '_' by '.') and *obj* (convert
into char*) and do a strcmp. But I'm not sure if openssl offers another way
to get oid other than OBJ_obj2txt().

Also it's my first time contributing to the Apache httpd project so I don't
know if I should open a bug at http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/ or open a
pull request on github. I would rather do the latter :)

Please feel free to give me any feedback about code, patch, documentation
etc...

Ghetolay.

Folks,

security@ got a notification of a potential side channel attack. The =
original message is below (sans details on the poster who wants to =
remain private).

In short - we=E2=80=99re comparing the digest in mod-auth-digest in a =
manner that may reveal how much is actually correct; leading potentially =
to a timing attack.

After discussing this on security@ we surmised that the risks are not =
overly high; and that fixing this may warrant some wider discussion/more =
eyeballs across the code base for similar things.

Options discussed sofar on security@ and general thoughts are:

1)	adding a timing safe compare to util_md5.c (for now) with=20
	an idea to move this to APR longer term.

	Besides the link below - =
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/master/src/libsodium/sodium/uti=
ls.c#L82 =
<https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/master/src/libsodium/sodium/ut=
ils.c#L82>=20
	and the openbsd one was mentioned.

2)	The mail below just comparison; there is an earlier strcmp
	comparision there as well.

3)	In general - string comparisons are more messy; as there is the =
length (difference)
	issue that is harder to hide. And moving the comparision into =
sha/md5 space is
	not trivial without a length related side channel on the =
checksum.

4)	Is this also a moment to reconsider the use of md5; and go to a =
decent SHA ?

5)	We have lots of other places which may need a bit of thought; =
Yann mentioned places
	like: Eg. strncmp(), strlen(), str[n]cat(), memcpy() and =
memcmp() are used
	by apr_md5_encode(), apr_password_validate(), apr_sha1_update(), =
=E2=80=A6

	Avoiding timing attacks requires at least to not use these =
functions
	in APR crypto, and have their equivalent there, and then use =
them
	where appropriate in httpd.

Thanks,

Dw.

No concern. I'm just to lazy to do it myself after goind down the %D 
route. Go ahead if you like. Most of us seem to favor it.

I think this has sat enough in STATUS that I'll commit by lazy consensus
prior to tag and roll of 2.2.30, unless anyone has a legitimate
correction/objection?

It might be worth mentioning that it's been in production for about 3-4
years or so, and only was delayed in 2.2 due to the unavoidable drift
between trunk/2.4 and 2.2 flavors.  We already included the
ported-afterwards functionality in the previous 2.4.12 release, with
apparently no issues.  The patch below is actually the origin of the
enhancement.

a bit as if they wouldn't work after this change.
Maybe something like "should be aligned"?

At some point, after a proposal has repeatedly morphed, the STATUS entry
has to be trashed and restarted from a fresh point of concensus.

The mod_log_config suggestions are at that point.  If nobody else acts by
the weekend, I'm moving it all to "Stalled".

Subject: Are 80 columns really that challenging?

I mentioned this w.r.t. a 2.2 STATUS entry, that it is not a good place for
a long-winded dialog...

But when it comes to STATUS and CHANGES, come on... the project has an 80
col style (76 if you want to remain legible through svn diff and similar)...

I'd like to review, but AFAICT this isn't a proposal that has consensus to
be reviewed yet, and combined with untangling the formatting, I'm not about
to cajole either party in either direction, it isn't worth the headache.

There are some "conversations" going on in the STATUS file
that should be done on dev@ instead, imo at least :)

In those circumstances it seems not so much CTR or RTC but rather
commonsense to go ahead.  Don't we have a bit of a history of
struggling to meet RTC criteria on Windows-specific backports?

I wonder if there's a case for formally adopting a lazy-consensus
policy based on what wrowe is doing here?  If a proposal has sat in
STATUS for a qualifying period, without attracting comment/
reservations, but also without attracting sufficient review +1s,
should it be eligible for lazy-consensus backport?
The proponent posts here on a "speak now or forever hold your peace"
basis, and goes ahead if no discussion calls it into question.

Some backports are lacking just 1 vote before we can merge them

I think Bill's main point is that other than himself and
gsmith, nobody else tests on MS/Win. I tried, but I never got
even to the point of getting it to even compile/build much
less to a point where I could *test* :)

I'm hoping for several things in the coming months, just began installing
and reviewing the community preview of Visual Studio 2015.  Again, there is
a free-to-use community edition.

Something very, very interesting there; they've come back around to the
idea of a long-lived C language runtime again (not msvcrt.dll, a successor
to the Visual Studio 2012 flavor).

So the 2015 team believes it will live on to the next generation products.
So did the VS '97 folks, so that is no guarantee, but it's hopeful.

Subject: Two questions on mod_ssl source code details
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

1) In other code I see

     EC_KEY_free(ecdh);

after

   EC_KEY *ecdh = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(...)
and using ecdh, e.g. in
   SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh(mctx->ssl_ctx, eckey);

Should we add the free? Or is it not needed? Anyone knows why?

2) In modules/ssl/ssl_private.h I see

/**
   * The following features all depend on TLS extension support.
   * Within this block, check again for features (not version numbers).
   */
#if !defined(OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT) && defined(SSL_set_tlsext_host_name)

#define HAVE_TLSEXT

and then further checks and defines for OCSP, Session Tickets, SRP, 
ALPN, all inside this "if" block.

Is it really true, that they are only supported if 
SSL_set_tlsext_host_name is defined? That function seems to belong only 
to SNI.

Should we switch the code to:

/**
   * The following features all depend on TLS extension support.
   * Within this block, check again for features (not version numbers).
   */
#if !defined(OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT)

#define HAVE_TLSEXT

#if defined(SSL_set_tlsext_host_name)
#define HAVE_SNI
#endif

and then use HAVE_SNI where appropriate.

Regards,

Rainer

This was added in r1666363:

* mod_ssl: fix small memory leak in ssl_init_server_certs when ECDH is used.
SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh increases reference count, so we have to call EC_KEY_free,
otherwise eckey will not be freed.

Yann.

I guess this was (one of) the first TLS extention added to OpenSSL,
hence OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT was probably defined at the same time as
SSL_set_tlsext_host_name.
This code checks if extensions are not disabled (OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT),
but that's relevent only if they exist in OpenSSL
(SSL_set_tlsext_host_name).

That would be true before OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT existed...

Damn, I was working my way though old patches to port them to Tomcat 
tcnative and forgot to check the current code.

I don't see where this can happen, but I may be missing something,
please correct me if I'm wrong.

Whenever ap_pass_brigade() is called, failing or not, the data_sent
flag is set to 1 (some data have been sent to the client).
Now outside the loop, in both cases where {client,backend}_failed
(i.e. any read or write error occured on the {client,backend} side) or
!request_ended (i.e. the last chunk was not received from the backend,
yet another misnaming), the final rv will be set to DONE (and won't
change until return, an error bucket 503 may be used if backend_failed
but not if the client connection was aborted).

I agree that the state maintained by as much variables is a mess (the
code has probably evolved by adding a new one to handle a new case, I
did not add any in this patch though), and we ought to simplify this,
but maybe we can leave it as is for 2.4.13 (and fix PR 56823) and
refactor soon?
I'd volonteer eventually...

Regards,
Yann.

I think this is somewhat because from what I've been reading, apparently 
Windows 10 will be good forever, "forever" at least being the life of 
the machine.  The Zen Master then replied, "We'll see."

So new default configs are improved, and that's great.

Any joint interest in maintaining a "guide to implementing SSL/TLS best 
practices" in the documentation for those that don't normally see our 
latest/greatest default configuration and/or need some extra prose 
around it?

A start would be:

* list source material for best practices
* describe how known tradeoffs (such as blocking old clients) are 
accommodated in the specific configuration recommendations
* the actual configuration related to best SSL/TLS practices from our 
current default SSL configs
* hints on how to configure these in our past releases as well as with 
distributions that have their own idea of file layout/own defaults

    So new default configs are improved, and that's great.<br>
    <br>
    Any joint interest in maintaining a "guide to implementing SSL/TLS
    best practices" in the documentation for those that don't normally
    see our latest/greatest default configuration and/or need some extra
    prose around it?<br>
    <br>
    A start would be:<br>
    <br>
    * list source material for best practices<br>
    * describe how known tradeoffs (such as blocking old clients) are
    accommodated in the specific configuration recommendations<br>
    * the actual configuration related to best SSL/TLS practices from
    our current default SSL configs<br>
    * hints on how to configure these in our past releases as well as
    with distributions that have their own idea of file layout/own
    defaults<br>

Thanks! I had this warning, fixed it, and still don't understand how
it did not finish in the original commit/backport...

Hi,

is there a chance to get the following revisions merged to 2.2.x
- r1551685, r1652929 (fix IPv4 mapping on FreeBSD)


In ssl_engine_dh.c there are calls to generate dh512 and dh1012,
perhaps it is also an idea to drop dh512 and add dh2048 or higher.

-system("openssl gendh $rand -out dh512.pem 512");
-system("openssl gendh $rand -out dh1024.pem 1024");
+system("openssl gendh $rand -out dh1024.pem 1024");
+system("openssl gendh $rand -out dh2048.pem 2048");


PS:
on my local 2.2.x test system 'ab.c' from 2.4.13 build fine, perhaps
this is also a candidate for a next 2.2.x release.

I wonder whether we should instead remove that whole embedded perl 
script. An improvement was ported back from 2.4 to 2.2 that means you 
can simply include the "openssl dhparam" output in the certificate file. 
In addition by default the next 2.2 will also choose a prime length 
corresponding to the RSA key length in the certificate. So in most cases 
user should be just fine. If admins want to tune, they can by generating 
params and appending them to the cert file.

What do you think: is there still a need for this embedded perl script?

Probably a bit to late for now. We are heading for a release real soon. 
But thanks for the heads up.

Proposed in r1681531.
As Rainer said, that would need two more votes before the release
(which is coming soon).

Testing building httpd 2.4.12 with VS2015 RC.  The PHP team is planning  to
use VC14 with PHP7, which is coming out later this year. Apachelounge want
to inline with them, a huge PHP user base.

All went "smoothly" and apachelounge is running it now.

You can download at http://www.apachelounge.com/viewtopic.php?p=30522 ,
included mod_fcgid build with VC14.  Win64 follows later.

Initially Apachemonitor did not build, but solved that (see below).
Also some very old third-party modules give syntax errors with the more
strict VS2015 and the authors are gone.  No problem for now because VC11 and
VC10 modules are running fine and is fully supported by Microsoft.

Build it with the GUI (no cmake or command line tried).  Build with
apr-1.5.1 (had to replace apr_atomic.c with the one from 1.5.2)
apr-util-1.5.4 apr-iconv-1.2.1 openssl-1.0.2a(+asm)  zlib-1.2.8(+asm)
pcre-8.37 libxml2-2.9.2 lua-5.1.5 expat-2.1.0

Errors and warning with Apachemonitor :

Error LNK2019 unresolved external symbol __setargv referenced in function
_WinMain@16 ApacheMonitor
C:\VC14\Win32\httpd-2.4.12\support\win32\ApacheMonitor.obj 1
Error LNK1120 1 unresolved externals ApacheMonitor
C:\VC14\Win32\httpd-2.4.12\support\win32\Release\ApacheMonitor.exe 1
Warning C4996 'GetVersionExA': was declared deprecated ApacheMonitor
C:\VC14\Win32\httpd-2.4.12\support\win32\ApacheMonitor.c

setargv() is supposed to read in the console args because thats a GUI app
and they have to use WinMain. For that to work, one should actually link
with setargv.obj
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bch7bkk%28v=vs.140%29.aspx . That
is not being done, so not sure how it even works with VC9/VC11. First I
tried to declare UNICODE, but thats a bad idea  the whole app isnt
prepared for that. Thus, Ive tried to remove the _setargv() call.

That worked  under VC14 argv seems to be set

The warning happens also with VS2013 and is reported here in the past.
Dev's should investigate on how to properly get OS versions, as win10 is
coming, also PHP deals with it: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=69642 . The
warning, while looking harmless actually, might get annoying as GetVersionEx
might deliver improper version on win10. The only checks I saw yet are about
ensuring the OS is at least w2k. So should be fine for now as even if it
delivers say win8 on win10, its still more advanced then win2k.

I see for fleeting moments that there's a sequence of setting of different
variables to certain values over the function that ensures that
HTTP_BAD_REQUEST is not set if an error occurred writing to the client.
Fun.

I'm sorry for the trouble.

An improvement was ported back from 2.4 to 2.2 that means you can simply include the "openssl dhparam" output in the certificate file. In addition by default the next 2.2 will also choose a prime length corresponding to the RSA key length in the certificate. So in most cases user should be just fine. If admins want to tune, they can by generating params and appending them to the cert file.

In my opinion the perl part is no longer required with the new code.

As a side note, running perl against ssl_engine_dh.c will change the type from
- static const unsigned char dh$num_p[]
+ static unsigned char dh$num_p[]

Ha! It is in trunk and 2.2, but the backport/changes in 2.4 were 
incomplete. Exactly the free is missing. Proposed now for 2.4 in STATUS.

Subject: mod_ssl: Reading dhparams and ecparams not only from the first certificate
 file
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Current mod_ssl code tries to read embedded DH and ECC parameters only 
from the first certificate file. Although this is documented

"DH and ECDH parameters, however, are only read from the first 
SSLCertificateFile directive, as they are applied independently of the 
authentication algorithm type."

I find it questionable. I would find it more natural to embed the params 
in the cert files they apply to, so e.g. the DH params in the RSA cert 
file and the EC params in the ECDH cert file and also to not require a 
special order for the files which at the end we do not check. Since 
missing the embedded params goes unnoticed (finding them is only a DEBUG 
log line) it is not very user friendly.

Can't we simply try to read DH and ECC params from every certificate 
file and stop in each of the two cases when we have found some? That 
would tighten the user unfriendlyness to the case of having multiple 
inconsistent parameters embedded in different cert files. And even that 
could be checked and logged as a warning.

I would suggest to move the param extraction a little above in the 
certificate loop and only try to extract and use the params if a 
previous extraction for that type did not already succeed. See below for 
a patch suggestion. It moved the read code into the cert loop, removes 
the NULL check for certfile (it is done in the loop condition), adds a 
boolean dhparams_found and ecparams_found to track whether we already 
found some and adds warnings if we find them more than once or if found 
ecparams are not valid. The final "auto" behavior setting stays after 
the loop and is executed if ecparams is still NULL.

Related is handling of keys embedded in cert files. AFAIK we only try to 
read the key from the certificate file instead of a configured key file, 
if there is no key file for the same index configured. That means if you 
start mixing embedded keys and separate key files, all certificates with 
separate key files must come first, then the certificates with the 
embedded keys (and the order must match).For this I don't have a better 
solution than just documenting it.

Regards,

Rainer

With that kind of directive it would also leave flexibility for this =
kind of thing:

DHParamsEC /tmp/example
DHParamsEC none
DHParamsEC auto

(that last case =E2=80=93 I'm imagining that httpd generates the D-H =
parameters at each startup, blocking use of ECDH until generation is =
complete).

Look in the STATUS file in the httpd v2.4 branch.

Similarly the STATUS file in other branches (eg v2.2) will list backport =
proposals there.

Hi Stefan,

The backports that are currently on vote are always in the STATUS file 
which sits in the top level directory of the respective branch in svn. 
For example:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x/STATUS?view=co

If an item has enough votes it is moved in the file from "PATCHES 
PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:" to "PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM 
TRUNK:". Next it gets applied to the code and removed from the file.

After the backport you can find the backported items in the CHANGES file 
in svn (if the backport contains a user facing change). Most backports 
also are done using "svn merge", so you can also look at the 
svn:mergeinfo property of the top level directory of the branch. Finally 
you can diff ...

Some parts can be applied without going through status, mostly docs 
changes and some platform specific things.

All changes be it to STATUS, to CHANGES or some other files in svn are 
mailed to cvs@httpd.apache.org to which you could subscribe, if you want 
to follow more closely.

Regards,

Rainer

Backports are proposed in the STATUS file of the target branch, where
each entry is removed once accepted and the backport is done.
There then only remains the CHANGES entry (if it was part of the
backport, but that's generally the case).

But obviously, for a change to receive enough votes, it has first to
be proposed in STATUS...

Regards,
Yann.

The file STATUS in 2.4.x shows current votes.

(See also CHANGES, which documents what has already made it).

I think the way forward is SSLOpenSSLConfCmd which tries to get rid of 
one new mod_ssl directive per new OpenSSL feature. But that is 1.0.2 
only. So for a transitory phase we need something else and at least me 
I'm happy, that you can already configure the params (by embedding in 
the cert file).

Flattery! (I experience I am not immune to this=E2=80=A6)

Thanks for all the replies! I am currently making a patch that contains =
all the ALPN changes from trunk and works in 2.4. Hope that someone then =
can include this as proposal in the 2.4.13 STATUS. May it find votes!

Back soonish...

Thanks for the many answers!

Now, can I win someone over to propose backporting the mod_ssl ALPN =
changes? I have prepared something:

 * mod_ssl: add ALPN support by allowing other modules to register =
callbacks=20
            for negotiation of the application layer protocol.
   trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/r1676709

   2.4.x patch: =
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icing/mod_h2/master/sandbox/httpd/patche=

I tested today=E2=80=99s httpd/branches/2.4.x + patch with mod_h2 on OS =
X, using openssl 1.0.2. Works for me.

Who goes?
It would be funny to have 4 proposals though... :)

X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.68 on 10.5.11.24

Hi,

currently the port for fcgi:// protocol defaults to 8000. Is there any 
reason why we use this port number as a default? Also, I think this 
default port number is not documented anywhere.

I'm asking, because php-fpm uses port 9000 by default. I know that these 
ports are not standardized and fcgi backend servers can use whatever 
ports they want, but maybe we could switch to 9000 and document this 
default port?

Regards,
Jan Kaluza

Why docs/manual/mod/*.html.en where modified here?
Shouldn't this be done in the xml files (only) instead?

Good catch.

Was done in r1676004 and reverted in r1681746. The latter slipped =
through my NPN/ALPN sieve.

So, basically the html changes should be removed from the patch.

Proposed in r1681749 by also including r1681741 (CHANGES entry) and
r1681746 (revert on HTML docs changes).
There is no vote for now though (I could not review it completely yet)...

Thanks for the work Stefan!

Folks,

Did a scan through a fair bit of our code. mod_digest is not the only =
place; e.g. in basic auth; we are also
not as careful in all cases as we could be.=20

So I think that what is needed are two (or three) functions

-	A fairly mundane (binary) timing safe compare that compares two =
fixed lengths (e.g. SHA or MD5)=20
	strings or binary buffers.

-	A string comparison function; where at least one string is is =
under control of the attacker.

As to the first - I think it can be as simple as below - as to the =
latter - see next email. As with that one I am struggling.

Now the issue here is that length is every easily revealed. So I can =
think of 2 strategies;

-	firmly declare (in the signature of the compare function) one =
argument as potentially hostile.

	And do the comparison largely based on that; which means we only =
marginally reveal the
	actual length of the string compared to. Below is an example; =
but my gut feel it is not
	nearly good enough when you can apply a large chunk of =
statistics against it.

-	treat them both as hostile; and scan for either the shortest or =
longest one and accept
	that you leak something about length.

	Or - if needed - pad this out for strings <1024 (or similar) =
chars in length by doing always
	that many (which will leak less).

Examples are below. Suggestions appreciated.=20

I initially thought openssl disabled the NULL ones by default but when i 
started playing with openssl cipher strings and saw them I got confused. 
  Didn't even consider that httpd did it automatically.  Documenting it 
would be a nice touch. Thanks for doing that.

When I added this with r1527295, I didn't expect custom [EC]DH
parameters in a certificate file to be the typical case for a mod_ssl
configuration - and even in the light of Logjam, I don't think that we
would want to recommend creating custom DH parameters for the average
admin. As long as 2048-bit RSA keys are configured (the standard for
certs issued by publicly-trusted CAs these days), there's nothing wrong
with relying on the built-in DH parameters, i.e. those from RFC 3526. [1]

I don't have strong feelings on this, but am not sure if it's worth
adding more code to address this specific case. My guess is that
multi-cert virtual host configurations with OpenSSL < 1.0.2 are
extremely rare, since they are prone to the
one-intermediate-CA-cert-only issue, and with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later,
SSLOpenSSLConfCmd is definitely preferrable.

As far as your observation "to embed the params in the cert files they
apply to" is concerned, I think there might be a misunderstanding here:
the [EC]DH parameters are orthogonal to the authentication algorithm -
for an RSA key, both are applicable (cf. openssl ciphers -v aRSA+DHE and
openssl ciphers -v aRSA+ECDHE).

> That means if you start mixing embedded keys and separate key files,

I would definitely discourage from doing so, and wouldn't bother with
adding configuration code to address such cases (would introduce
unneeded complexity). Putting the the private key into the
SSLCertificateFile has been discouraged since the 2.0 release, actually
- see the SSLCertificateKeyFile docs added with r93825. What is probably
missing is a more prominent notice in the section on SSLCertificateFile.

OK I'll have a look at the docs an see whether I can improve them.

Anyone else think it's time to EOL 2.2 and focus
on 2.4 and the next gen? My thoughts are that http/2
and mod_h2 will drive the trunk design efforts and so
it would be nice to focus energy on 2.4 and later...

Mario, I did get it working, but I did have a bit more effort to make
the latest openssl work.  Taking a quick look at your blog I believe I
can help, but I'll explain my solution in a follow-up message so this
thread is on the public mailing lists.

I feel I must explain that I'm using a Debian 7, 64-bit server.  It
might help if we could know your server info as other architectures
may require more or other tweaks.

Finally, the best I can probably do is show you my configure options
which may conflict with yours.

TO BE CONTINUED....

Best regards,

-Tom

No issue for me.

How many time would bug/security fixes would still be backported (from
when we decide so)?

I think it's an accurate reflection of a mode we're nearly in already, but
I think we should still be rolling up security releases of 2.2.x for some
time.  Is there something between legacy and EOL?  Maybe just an
announcement and a tweak to the description of 2.2.x?  I also think if we
choose some middle ground, we don't have to announce with any kind of delay.

People here focus their energy on whatever they want.  It takes a small
number of people to keep a stable branch going (technically 3, but in
practice a slightly higher number).  Instead of the group choosing EOL or
only-security-fixes-of-some-minimal-severity or something else for a stable
branch based on what many people think is interesting to them for whatever
reason, I think that the project should limit its concern to ensuring that
the community understands the state of the branch and that it is EOL-ed
when a sufficient number of people don't care.

What we need to know for the 2.2.x branch is basically this:

Developers (committers or not):

[  ] I am willing to help resolve security issues in the 2.2.x branch.
[  ] I am willing to help address non-security issues in the 2.2.x branch.

PMC members:

[  ] I am willing to test and vote on proposed 2.2.x releases.

Maybe this comes up to the same answer, maybe not.

(This is not a call for vote; I'm suggesting a very different mindset
towards 2.2.x from "nice to focus energy on" and "time to EOL 2.2 and focus
on".)

actually, "when a sufficient number of people don't care" is what I'm
arguing against :)  make that "when an insufficient number of people care"

Nope, we'll let the internet speak for itself -

http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_details/ws-apache/2

We are nowhere near close enough to the inflection point of that graph to
justify starting the 12 month EOL clock (which has been our traditional
countdown, same as the Tomcat project).

That sounds about right.  I'm personally interested in 3.0 - refactoring on
trunk to clean up the evolution of httpd since 2.0.36.  That was when we
froze MMN majors, so many many bits are now shoehorned into the server in
very awkward manners.  This will make backports to 2.4 more complex,
however.

Looks a sensible approach to me.

As it turns out, 0.9.2b disabled aNULL/eNULL by default.  Export ciphers
are disabled by default as of 0.9.8zf/1.0.0r/1.0.1m/1.0.2a.

Here's my proposed comment to inject in trunk/2.4/2.2 default
httpd-ssl.conf - any adjustments here?

# httpd 2.2.30, 2.4.13 and later force-disable aNULL, eNULL and EXP ciphers,
# while OpenSSL disabled these by default in 0.9.8zf/1.0.0r/1.0.1m/1.0.2a.

Yes, if you don't specify any ciphersuite (ie. no SSLCipherSuite in httpd).

AFAICT, they are not even selectable (not in ALL and EXP is ignored)...

Hi Tom,

I tried on Debian 7 and 8 both x64

To see your configure options would help a lot.

The missing symbol is in the lib.

mario@sasuke:~$ whereis libssl.so
libssl: /usr/lib/libssl.a /usr/lib/libssl.so


mario@sasuke:~$ readelf -s /usr/lib/libssl.so | grep "SSL_CONF_CTX_free"
   531: 0000000000053700    34 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   11 SSL_CONF_CTX_free
   901: 0000000000053700    34 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   11 SSL_CONF_CTX_free


mario@sasuke:~$ readelf -s /usr/lib/libssl.so | grep "SSL_CONF_CTX_finish"
   532: 00000000000536f0     6 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   11 SSL_CONF_CTX_finish
   327: 00000000000536f0     6 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   11 SSL_CONF_CTX_finish


Cheers
Mario

My point is that if we EOL 2.2 (with some definition of "EOL")
then people on 2.2 (or earlier) will have some *real* incentive
to move off of 2.2 towards 2.4 (or later)...

Basically, we need something to "kick" people off 2.2
and get them to 2.4. By stating that 2.2 will ONLY get
security related fixes and no new features or improvements,
and that 2.2 will be EOL by 201X, that will be encouragement.
That, of course, assumes that we "care" one way or another
about moving people to a more up-to-date and performant
httpd, as well as whatever the future holds for httpd.

FWIW: It was this month's PMC status report which kind of
      spurred this email.

Please assume not :)  ASF projects should still remain
scratch-your-own-itch(es).

Your message certainly had an 'adopt my agenda' tone to it, but I similarly
didn't assume this was belligerent :)

Define "people".  The overwhelming majority of "people" use whatever is
distributed with their OS.

If your "people" are the distributors, just surveying current and
immediately forthcoming distributions, it seems the message got through
loud and clear.

Basically, we need something to "kick" people off 2.2

We've always used the 1 year yardstick, and from the graphs and
distribution EOL's, 1 year is too soon.

At the Tomcat project they generally support 3 major/minor releases in
parallel.  Here, our support has oscillated between 2 and 3 releases since
2.0.36.  A new minor release has usually been the trigger to EOL the 3rd
oldest release.  In the real-world, we won't hit a point where there is
only one major/minor release is wide use, not unless we slow the pace of
major/minor releases to once every ten years ... not a goal to aspire to.

It should be readily apparent from CHANGES for 2.2 and 2.4 which gets more
attention.  All of our announcements clarify that 2.4.new is the latest and
greatest.

If there are three PMC folks who want a bug fixed in 2.2, what is your
point in establishing an agenda against that fix?  In a BDFL project, that
posturing is expected.

Clearly there are very few bug fixes that attract developer's attention on
2.2 anymore.  A better and perhaps less offensive question might be; how do
we, as a project, communicate how legacy the legacy release really is?

That, of course, assumes that we "care" one way or another

Is there a reason you imply that contributors at this project don't seek
this?  The only divisions I see on the horizon are gaining consensus on the
scope of any radical changes between 2.4.x and httpd-next.

crazy and not-so-crazy ideas will speed the movement to 2.4 irrespective of
distro schedules (not sure how much :) )

* something like this (and well-publicized) for every Linux distro:
https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/apache2
(I don't think I'm doing many people a favor if I show configure
invocations when I talk about 2.4; for most people it isn't a good idea to
build httpd themselves)
* upgrade Saturdays: IRC 2.2->2.4 upgrade events once a month  (not to say
that isn't available already, but maybe there are psychological aspects of
this that drive upgrade)
* compelling documentation of use cases that feature 2.4; e.g., full
deployment templates that include 2.4 as one part

No need to go off... 2.2 has been out for almost 10 years.
2.4 for a bit over 3. That is a LONG time. I'm simply
*suggesting* (no BDFL posturing Mr. Rowe) that after 10
years, maybe it's time to say that 2.2's era is done, and
2.4's time is here, if not already past. I'm simply trying
to encourage us to work on the future and not "focus" on
the past. No need to read anything more into that, or
take on a onerous or holier-than-thou tone.

My apologies if "Anyone else think it's time to EOL 2.2 and focus
on 2.4 and the next gen?" was such an egregious question!
Shame on me for even asking! :)

Here one: Since containers are the new hotness, how about being
more Docker/Rocket/whatever friendly (whatever that means)? :)

Hope making this suggestion is OK and that OtherBill doesn't think
I'm BDFL posturing! *duck*

Now that even stability-loving Debian is providing 2.4.x with full security support, moving on from 2.2 seems to make sense.

one thing it means is having compelling stories involving the latest hot
tech that use 2.4

basically, any time there is a how-to-FOO somewhere on the www that uses
nginx for the web server component, there needs to be a better how-to-FOO
that uses httpd 2.4 ;)  (I don't even think 2.2 is an issue here)

That's interesting.  I believe those methods are new to 1.0.2
and AFAIK neither debian 7 nor 8 ship with openssl 1.0.2


https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=openssl

wheezy (7) ships with 1.0.1e with patches
jessie (8) ships with 1.0.1k with patches

so for your /usr/lib/libssl.so to contain those functions means you 
either compiled your own openssl and installed them into /usr/lib or 
pulled in a testing/unstable package.

Either way, there was clearly a symbol mismatch.  I build Apache 2.4 
with openssl 1.0.2 (i also build this) and have no problems.

The key is, I make a self-contained structure, so you need be sure to 
use the proper LD_LIBRARY_PATH to allow, at runtime, things to be able 
to find the right openssl libraries.

For example, my shell script that builds pcre, openldap, openssl, and 
apache sets this:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$APACHE_ROOT/lib:$OPENSSL_ROOT/lib:$OPENLDAP_ROOT/lib:$PCRE_ROOT/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

And I build in the following order:
pcre
openssl
openldap
httpd

and have no problems.

Agreed +1.  That's nice and informative.
I couldn't tell from the discussion if this config was being pushed in 
to 2.2.  It is?  If so, that's great.  It'll help me justify pushing it 
to our customer shipping installations.

Specifically, http://svn.apache.org/r1243503

Generally unusable, the next several versions fixed the serious regressions
and we had a pretty solid release by 2.4.3/2.4.4 timetable (about 2 1/2
years ago).

Given the lag between a release, incorporating it into an alpha of a
distribution release, and that distribution going GA, that is a long lag.

Ubuntu - 14.04 LTS, and Debian 8 (Jessie) got the message, a year ago April.

RHEL / CentOS 7 aren't even a year old yet.

OpenSUSE 13.1 beat them all to the punch, back in Nov of '13.  So that's
the oldest distribution GA that I've found, perhaps Fedora beat that?

So your 'over 3 years' is a pretty gross exaggeration if you are speaking
of "users" as people who get httpd from their OS distribution.

And the empirical data says, nope.  Nearly 80% of installed httpd is still
2.2.  RedHat and the others all have years ahead supporting httpd-2.2.

Your suggestion is duly noted and filed :)

By which your message might be perceived as taking a holier-than-thou
tone.  Since neither of us would do that, let's move on :)

So folks (who don't build themselves) have only had 11 - 18 months to start
picking up httpd 2.4, that doesn't seem like the distant past to me, and
seems like forever ago to you, that's fine.  We are an association of peers
with different interests and responsibilities, and have different
perspectives on our end user communities.

Everything we can do to help them move forward is great.  If the insist on
running httpd 2.4 on Ubuntu 12.04-LTS or RHEL 5, well... the wiki
especially could offer help with that.  There are already per-architecture
notes and wiki pages.  Hopefully they adopt a modern operating system and
modern releases of Apache projects across the board.

My apologies if "Anyone else think it's time to EOL 2.2 and focus
> on 2.4 and the next gen?" was such an egregious question!
> Shame on me for even asking! :)


Ask away!  Below was the discussion result last month.  I'd expect this to
be brought up monthly until "maintainers" get bored with the dialog and an
EOL is pushed through :)

Agreed. Plus the fact that nginx is really open core, and
being heavily promoted and marketed by nginx.com, does put
httpd, as a "real" open source project at some disadvantage.

We should ping Sally for some thoughts. Also, I know that
we could likely get a monthly column from opensource.com
(or every other month) to help w/ combating the FUD.

Your thought seems to be that we "EOL" 2.2 when the number of
2.2 deployments < the number of 2.4 ones. My thought is that
we "EOL" 2.2 in order to *hasten* that event, just like just
about every other open-source and non-open source software
project out there.

Not wanting to boast, but maybe mod_h2 for httpd 2.4 can play a role in moti=
vating people to migrate away from 2.2.=20

I have not looked into having it work on 2.2 and no interest in doing so. If=
 we get the ALPN support into 2.4.13, mod_h2 can be just "dropped in" to suc=
h a server. And distros will have an incentive to include it.

In what amount that might influence 2.2 migrations, probably no one can fore=
tell. And I have not the insight to what all others reasons for migration ar=
e, not knowing enough about the differences myself. I just want to point out=
 that it can be one selling point among others.

As to how to sell it: I have made some performance tests and published some n=
umbers based on my single dev installation. It could certainly help to get s=
ome more numbers in a more real world like env to either have a story to tel=
l - or find out what still needs to be done.

What is floating around in the net are numbers from eithers servers no one c=
an install (google) or servers that focus on http2 like h2o or nghttpd. But t=
hose are not general purpose servers, serve often only static files and some=
times even fail under load. I'm not saying they are bad implementations (far=
 from it), there just not in the domain as httpd.

cheers, Stefan

I know we have some infrastructure lurkers here.

How can we pilot test cwiki performance, and what assistance is available
for migrating content from wiki->cwiki if we like it?

I got the impression a migration was imminent around ACNA, what's the
current outlook?  Is there someplace we can track?

Not directly related to the EoL discussion, but some additional notices why
a change to 2.4 takes some time.

There where are some deal breakers for users to keep 2.2 running, most of
them are fixed meanwhile.

E.g.

- mod_perl was for a long time not usable with 2.4, as a workaround most
  porters / packagers are shaping mod_perl for 2.4 directly from mod_perl
  trunk, now we see a first 2.0.9-rc1.
- for long time there was no working mod_php module for 2.4, and changing to
  php-fpm was not for everyone a solution.
- a bunch of third party modules are written for 2.0.x and do not build
  against 2.4, in some cases simply fixing
  s/r->useragent_ip/r->connection->remote_ip/ does the trick to make users
  happy

I remember endless discussions removing apache 1.3 from the ports tree even
one year after the 1.3 EoL, and the complain was not only from end users.

huh? 

I personally since dawn of the httpd/php love have always only ever used
mod_php and at no time did I have a a non usable server with 2.4.x and
mod_php, so I have NFI where you get this "long time" from, or any-time
that I can see. I hope you just doubled up on your mod_perl, because
that certainly was for a VERY long time not compatible with 2.4 (as you
earlier mentioned).

Or, a few here care about the users stuck in the situation of using the
software in front of them, instead of dovetailing sideways against the
current to build themselves a package that isn't in their distribution's
repository.  A few of us are very focused on the actual users using the
actual software they were presented with.

Hopefully, in a few years time, nobody will ever again be presented with
2.2, or 2.0, or 1.3.  Given the most-common 3-year refresh cycle followed
in our industry, that would mean about a year-and-a-half from now for SuSE
users, and more than two years from now for the poor RHEL and CentOS users.

Enough of this ad-hominem BS... this is in fact a majority rule decision
(it is a vote
not on code but on procedure), and is binding on the project as a whole.  I
don't
want to discuss this again for six months and I'm not keen on the smug
little
trolls telling me what I should and should not be working on at a project
that
I participate at.

To round out, but by no means complete this survey, Fedora 18 shipped
1-15-13, so it in fact beat OpenSuSE GA by 10 months (if you consider a
fedora release a 'release' - shrug).

I think I would have preferred Jeff's form of the vote, which would
have allowed us to know the potential "operating forces" on 2.2.x.
Sure people like having their release maintained, for free is even
better, the investment is done either by the committers (for all
living versions) or the users (upgrading).
So let's see the overall effort in the next six months...

We determined from that poll that there were >3 committers who
would fix bugs on 2.2, so that discussion was already done.  Sadly
this was ignored by Noel deciding to 'pile on'.  I really hope nobody
piles on to anything other than their own interests in contributing
to this project.  That should be devoid of persons and personalities.

They like having their new releases for free even more-so.  What
inspired you to call out 'free' as in cash-in-lieu-of-beer?

No, it's not an either-or proposition.  Committers, for those who
aren't in a position to upgrade (and only those who maintain an
interest, e.g. those >3 who responded to Jeff's survey).  And the
users who are stuck in an update trajectory, for the time being,
or who have the freedom to upgrade (preferably, their entire host
or container OS).

You've lost the argument and lost respect, you have demonstrated that by
this pathetic and childish response. Just because others have a
different opinion to you, does NOT make them a troll William, nor does
warrant your bordering on bullying immature response, when you grow up
and become an adult again, I'll take your concerns seriously.

Noel,

Frankly, I don't care whether you take my concerns seriously or not, that
is irrelevant.

If you have a vote, please vote [changed subject, your reply didn't belong
on a vote thread without casting a vote - find the top-post.]  I and all
PMC members will respect your vote, and each of our peers' votes.

Indeed, if you are continuing to chiding me and other committers for not
doing what you would have us do, you are indeed a troll.  If you are asking
whether or not you can focus your efforts on 2.4, nobody has been blocking
you from doing so, exclusively.  If you are imposing your direction upon
fellow committers, and then mocking them for their interests other than
your own, than you sir, really, truly are the troll.

But if that is not what you or others meant to imply, of course I would
retract that unjustified characterization!

Yours sincerely,

Bill

Why just 2 options and why *these* 2?

The VOTE is worthless and obviously designed to stop discussion.
I am not voting.

That was an informal poll, whereas an official one would probably have
allowed us to count ourselves and maybe see if we can still maintain
2.2 effectively.
Speeking for myself, if the cost of using (hence backporting to) 2.2.x
exceeds significantly the one
(technical/political/educational/whatever-al) of upgrading to 2.4.x,
I'll choose the latter...
ISTM that it's also a question of workforce, not that I doubt about
committers wrt 2.2.x, I just wish I had a better idea with that poll
(>3 is nice to know, but so is <?).

I meant free of time, work, or elbow/finger grease ;)

Well, some (maybe most, but not all!) won't move unless/until they
face a missing security/bug fix in 2.2.x.
Why would they if they don't need a new feature, and why will they in
1/2/3.. years?

One thing I've been thinking about, and there might even be some hooks
in trunk for it, is the idea of slave connections (or sub-connections)
which kind of *is* a pseudo connection. So one could create a connection
and then a sub/slave connection from that, and then use *that* for
requests. This maintains the connection->request idea, but allows for
multiple connections and requests per a single "real" connection.

I've just looked at your "internals" page (which seems to me
an excellent piece of work), and it tends to support the gut
feeling that mod_h2 might be better targeting 2.6/3.0 than 2.4.
We should be joining forces to address the issues you've
encountered, from minor tweaks to core to more fundamental issues
like bucket alloc across threads (or a suitable alternative).

Time for me to download and take a proper look at your work,
and put my money (or at least time&effort) where my mouth is!

That would be useful - and perhaps fold/kill some of the internal =

My thoughts are that we use mod_h2 as a guide to how to
"better" implement things in trunk, but also allow for
mod_h2 to also work w/ 2.4 as well... So there will be
a 2.4 version of mod_h2 as well as a more significant
"merging" of mod_h2/trunk/2.6/3.0.

I propose we - where possible - add the missing bits that mod_h2 has to =
hack around, and then propose those changes for backport to v2.4 in the =
normal way.

Given the amount of inertia minor versions of httpd have, it would be =
ideal if mod_h2 could be used in the httpd v2.4 timeframe, rather than =
being forced to wait for v2.6.

Obviously if there is anything majorly incompatible that we=E2=80=99ll =
struggle with then the choice will be made for us, but we should try get =
mod_h2 usable with v2.4 if that can possibly be achieved.

That makes most sense to me as well.=20

Besides all the non-optimal things I discuss in the internals paper, the =
numbers - of my very limited measurements - show that mod_h2 is slightly =
less performant than plain httpd *if you only have a single =
request/connection at a time*. If you have 2 requests ongoing you break =
even or are slightly better. And then it grows up to 50% more =
requests/sec than with HTTP/1.1 (all measured over TLS). Of course this =
varies with resource size and such...

Since browsers will typically want to get quite some resources from the =
server for a page, this should already in 2.4 bring benefit for =
everyone.

cheers, Stefan

I 100% agree!

There is stuff that needs to be "hacked around" in 2.4 but would
be somewhat easy to implement (or rather *finish* implementing)
in trunk, but would not be backportable.=20

Giving this some thought for the string version, does it make sense to loop
the underflow string back to offset zero on EOS?  There is a certain amount
of cache avoidance that could cause, but it would dodge the optimization of
that phase and ensure the longest-match comparisons are performed (measured
by the untrusted input, presumably).

>=20
So I am currently experimenting with=20

	https://gist.github.com/dirkx/37c29dc5a82b6deb0bf0 =
<https://gist.github.com/dirkx/37c29dc5a82b6deb0bf0>

which seems to behave reasonably and does not get optimized out too far. =
 We could perhaps do something where we change the i1/i2 loop indexes
by str[i % i1] instead of i1/i2 that =E2=80=98stop=E2=80=99; and keep i1 =
one higher than i until we hit the \0.

many hundrets of vhosts running for many years that way with automatic=20
deployment of such rules depending on the target application

Having to expend effort (e.g. re-design/update config and deployment) to =

With fpm and mod_proxy_fcgi, I don't see myself ever using mod_php =
again, but that's just me.

The project's definition... no, the ASF definition of effective
participants -is- 3 :)

I've packed it in when code bases no longer had that number of
participants.  E.g. the 1.3/2.0 EOL was by unanimous consensus, retiring
mod_aspdotnet was by unanimous consensus.  The mod_arm4 code should likely
also be retired, I wouldn't anticipate an objection.

Where 1 or 2 individuals want an effort to persist at the ASF, and cannot
find a third hand, that is a sad outcome, but hasn't happened at httpd that
I recall.  It is unlikely to be the case here, either.

Agreed, and that's why I just responded to the poll.  Most backports won't
reach that threshold for most of us.  Complex patches may be proposed and
die for want of 3 sets of eyeballs.  That is ok, too.

Why indeed.  Hopefully we offer compelling reasons.  I'm much more
concerned to help people avoid provisioning an old crufty version such as
2.2.30 versus adopting 2.4.13 from the get-go.  Whatever we can do to help
with that aught to be welcomed by the user community.

Thanks for your thoughts.

The pseudo-poll was the clearest way I could think of to lay out my opinion
of what I think our criteria should be, and I didn't want to come across as
antagonistic anyway (random-emoticon)  But the several responses are useful
information.  Cut and paste at will!

I think there is a story in all of this for the greater community about our
(?) particular take on an open source project, pros and cons for

* individual developers
* different classes of users
* the httpd-of-Christmas-future,

our strong desire avoid unplanned obsolescence, our willingness to empower
even potentially small subsets of our developer community, etc.

(Meanwhile, somebody pinged me about mod_fcgid recently; apparently there
is some low-hanging fruit in Bugzilla and no any recent activity :( )

Anyone can take the time to implement and automate the switch. Once that effort has been spent, you should have nearly the same (maybe better) setup, with hopefully better security and resource utilization in many cases. All of those php_admin_* directives end up in a php-fpm conf file that can easily be automatically updated and deployed.

It would be worth providing a bash/perl/python script that one could 
point at your config files and/or .htaccess files and poop out php-fpm 
conf files as part of the documentation. The advantages of moving from 
mod_php to php-fpm are not extolled enough.

Just because others have a different opinion to you, does NOT make them a troll William, nor does warrant your bordering on bullying immature response, when you grow up and become an adult again, I'll take your concerns seriously.

Noel, 

Frankly, I don't care whether you take my concerns seriously or not,
that is irrelevant. 

If you have a vote, please vote [changed subject, your reply didn't
belong on a vote thread without casting a vote - find the top-post.] I
and all PMC members will respect your vote, and each of our peers'
votes. 

Indeed, if you are continuing to chiding me and other committers for not
doing what you would have us do, you are indeed a troll. If you are
asking whether or not you can focus your efforts on 2.4, nobody has been
blocking you from doing so, exclusively. If you are imposing your
direction upon fellow committers, and then mocking them for their
interests other than your own, than you sir, really, truly are the
troll. 

But if that is not what you or others meant to imply, of course I would
retract that unjustified characterization! 

Yours sincerely, 

Bill 

like I said previously William, when you grow back up and can act like
an adult, you can then and only then email me directly and we can
continue this debate, until such time, save your breath, because I have
no time for immature childish brats.

By all means then, don't.

To answer your question, these are the only two directions the project has
taken over the last 15 years, as I documented this afternoon.
Counterexamples would be welcome.

This conversation reoccurs consistently with the same two opposing agendas;
1. Prevent committers from burning cycles on old branches, vs. 2. Support
old branches while they are widely deployed.  The many threads you can read
in our archives follow the same pattern each time.  In general, Jeff's much
more diplomatic answer becomes the consensus, and the project moves on.

To answer your more detailed question;

This 12 month window seems to have universal consensus from the email
archives, once a consensus is reached.  Other numbers are often mentioned,
and it always boils back down to a year.

This too is the typical window for revisiting cold threads (actually, more
like 6-18/mos, so I picked the short end of that range).  Your particular
post was a month after the question was asked and answered and (notably)
not contradicted.  If there was disagreement there was a perfectly valid
thread to resume and debate the particulars of either a prompt EOL or a
longer window of time.

Your top-post clearly advocated for the first choice, but perhaps was
incomplete?  I am very receptive to the details you left out of that top
post, that would have offered us a third-way that none of us expected, if
only you had the free cycles the other morning to flesh out that unique
proposal. Sincerely, please suggest something we haven't considered before,
otherwise this is the same old same old again.

Hi Tom,

nope setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH did not solve my problem. That is a bit
tricky since I install the new openssl version system wide

./config --prefix=/usr zlib-dynamic --openssldir=/etc/ssl shared no-ssl2

Thanks for all the feedback. With a bit of help from Martijn Boekhorst =
and Andy Armstrong I got as far as:

	https://gist.github.com/dirkx/37c29dc5a82b6deb0bf0 =
<https://gist.github.com/dirkx/37c29dc5a82b6deb0bf0>

which I am now testing against a wide range of settings & compilers (in =
essence running a side channel attack on it and see how far I get with =
the various variations).

However I could use some help & manual inspection ?

So if you have the time & can read assembler well - can you compile this =
at a reasonable optimizer setting and look at the assembler to confirm =
that key elements are not somehow optimized away; i.e. the innner loop =
is running in constant time. I am fairly sure about what happens on ARM =
and x386 =E2=80=94 but modern x86 is largely voodoo to me.

Secondly - when we get to the end of the shorter string; we can either =
keep comparing to the last char or \0; or we go =E2=80=98modulo=E2=80=99 =
to the start of the string. Now modulo is perhaps not ideal; and seems =
to affect the pipeline on the XEON cpu (something I confess not to quite =
understand; and I cannot see/replicate on ARM).

So I would also love to have feedback on the two strategies in the code =
w.r.t. to that - and not getting hit by pipeline length; L3 caches or =
odd things like page boundaries.

Above GIST has the full code - the simpliefied version below (which does =
not have the 1024 min length).

Dw.

You might want to reconsider that unless you really really are sure you kno=
w what you're doing.
On a linux distro, the system installed openssl is considered a fundamental=
 platform infrastructure library.  I.e. many many things rely on it.  opens=
sl versions are not backward compatible.

So if you don't rebuild all of your distro installed dependencies on openss=
l, you've likedly just screwed up runtime linking of alot of things.

Also, the system installed library and the openssl config makefiles may be =
using incompatible soname mechanisms, which could explain why you're able t=
o link but not run (i.e. at linktime it may be finding the right library, b=
ut at runtime it's not).

Hi Tom,

nope setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH did not solve my problem. That is a bit
tricky since I install the new openssl version system wide

./config --prefix=3D/usr zlib-dynamic --openssldir=3D/etc/ssl shared no-ssl=

I didn't follow the whole thread, but about linking versus running:

at link time the linker will use the files libssl.so and libcrypto.so 
(or libssl.a and libcrypto.a). Because all it is given is -lssl and 
-lcrypto as flags.

It will look in those files for an entry named SONAME. On linux you can 
see that name by issuing

objdump -p /path/to/my/libssl.so

and

objdump -p /path/to/my/libcrypto.so

Example output:

/path/to/my/libssl.so:     file format elf64-x86-64

Program Header:
...

Dynamic Section:
   NEEDED               libcrypto.so.1.0.0
   NEEDED               libdl.so.2
   NEEDED               libz.so.1
   NEEDED               libc.so.6
   SONAME               libssl.so.1.0.0
...

Version References:
   required from libc.so.6:
     0x09691a75 0x00 02 GLIBC_2.2.5

Here you can see the SONAME is libssl.so.1.0.0. This name is added as a 
dependency into the linked binary. At runtime the runtime linker will 
look for this file, not for libssl.so.

During installation of lobssl.so (resp. libcrypto.so) typically the 
files get linked using a symlink, so it would make no difference. If you 
start to overwrite parts of the system installation, the two names might 
point to different content.

About compatibility: OpenSSL 1.0.0 up to OpenSSL 1.0.2 have compatible 
APIs, that's why the SONAME ends with .1.0.0 in all three cases. It is 
definitely possible to upgrade, i.e. use a newer version in the 1.0.0 to 
1.0.2 range during runtime than was used during compile/link time. The 
other way round only holds for patch versions with the same first three 
digits.

The SSL_CONF_CTX_* symbols you were originally referring to are only 
part of 1.0.2. So it seems you compiled against header files from 1.0.2 
and likely also loinked against a 1.0.2 libssl.so, but at runtime the 
libssl.so.1.0.0 that the runtime linker finds is version 1.0.0 or 1.0.1. 
The runtime linker has a search path that is defined on the system and 
can be influenced using LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The compile time linker is also 
influenced by compile "-L" flags.

Whether some specific libssl.so (or libssl.so.1.0.0) file contains the 
symbol or not can be checked using the "nm" command:

nm /path/to/my/libssl.so1.0.0 | grep SSL_CONF_CTX

Example output here:

00000000000581a0 T SSL_CONF_CTX_clear_flags
0000000000058180 T SSL_CONF_CTX_finish
0000000000058250 T SSL_CONF_CTX_free
00000000000582f0 T SSL_CONF_CTX_new
0000000000058280 T SSL_CONF_CTX_set1_prefix
0000000000058190 T SSL_CONF_CTX_set_flags
00000000000581b0 T SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl
0000000000058200 T SSL_CONF_CTX_set_ssl_ctx

If the symbols are not contained you will get no hits, if they are only 
referred in the lib but contained in another depenency lib, you get a 
"U" marker instead of the "T" (also see the nm man page for more 
possible cases).

Yeah, I honestly wasn't really thinking that closely about it.  I do 
know this.

The openssl default install results in the following:
libssl.so.1.0.0
symlinked to
libssl.so

however, fedora's system provided libraries look like this:
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     16 Mar 19 12:37 libssl.so.10 -> libssl.so.1.0.1k
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 439572 Mar 19 12:37 libssl.so.1.0.1k

So depending on how the linker finds the library, this could be kind of 
a mess.

And I no longer have a debian system so wasn't sure how debian's system 
installs are.

Also, in the past I've noticed linux distros "re-base" include headers 
to be in /usr/include directly vs under include/openssl where the 
openssl distro normally installs them.

So i generally figure that the notion of replacing a distro provided 
openssl is just a bad bad idea unless you really really know what you're 
doing.

Debian is the same. And I nevr and any issues compiling against a symlink.

Hi Andy,

it seems that you are right. After cheking the lib I saw this

-rw-r--r--  1 root root 4,4M Mai 29 10:51 libcrypto.a
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   18 Mai 29 10:51 libcrypto.so -> libcrypto.so.1.0.0
-r-xr-xr-x  1 root root 2,6M Mai 29 10:51 libcrypto.so.1.0.0
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 744K Mai 29 10:51 libssl.a
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   15 Mai 29 10:51 libssl.so -> libssl.so.1.0.0
-r-xr-xr-x  1 root root 499K Mai 29 10:51 libssl.so.1.0.0

that shows the current date, but the old version number.

Don't be fooled.

OpenSSL 1.0.1 did not break binary compatibility, the lib designation
remains .so.1.0.0.  Can someone confirm whether this was changed in 1.0.2?

It didn't break api compatibly but it sure did break backwards compatibilit=
y. I'm pretty sure if you link against 1.0.2 you can't run with an older 1.=
0.x library. Which is what appears to happen in Mario's case.=20

I'm speculating as to why - being related to improperly replacing a system =
package management maintained library.=20

That's correct. If the app or lib you compile uses symbols only 
available in newer versions, then this is true. An example is mod_ssl. 
The runtime version needs to have the same SONAME and must have at least 
the same numeric OpenSSL version as the compile version.

I don't get the "why": Why what? Why his runtime version is older than 
the version used during compile time? For that he would have to track 
down the files used. I tried to gave hints how to do that.

Rainer

Hi!

A gentle reminder that I had submitted this patch and would like
to know if someone has had time to review it and/or would like
further modifications. 

Should I add a bugzilla entry so that it doesn't fall under the radar?

Thanks! Kudos.

nearly the same (maybe better) setup, with hopefully better security and

Thinking about this more, what are the things preventing people from an
_easy_ upgrade path configuration-wise? A lot of this conversation
surrounded users and the impact of an upgrade to them. The interface for
the users' to the server is the configuration file. Maybe if we can
tackle that we can greatly reduce a barrier to upgrade (or maybe I'm too
optimistic)?

For the majority of my configs, it was the changes to the authorization
directives - it takes brainpower to figure out what AdminXYZ was trying
to do years ago and reflect that with the new directives. However, this
is deterministic... a perl script could do this work for me if I'd just
write it.

At $dayjob, this is the stuff I focus on. Tweaks to an existing script I
put together years ago to upgrade from 2.0 to 2.2 (or as Rich eloquently
put, "poop out" new configs) only required an hour's worth of work or so
to support upgrades from 2.2 to 2.4 minus the aforementioned authz
directives.

....aaaaaand on the original topic at hand, I'll share that none of us
are really *forced* to focus on any particular branch or any particular
area of the code base. As an army of volunteers, we scratch our own
itch. I, too, have noticed that 2.2 hasn't had a whole lot going on
lately. I don't know if that means we ought to get ready to drop the axe
on it, but I also don't know if that means we shouldn't be thinking
about it, either.

I think Jim's email served it's purpose of at least vocalizing a thought
that's probably in the back of all of our minds: 2.2 isn't getting a ton
of love (or at least as much love as 2.4) lately. What that means to
each of us is clearly different... for me, I noticed that the effort to
backport some of the work I've done in 2.4 doesn't pay off so I don't do
it. I haven't put much more thought into 2.2 than that. For others it
might be a push to backport more stuff.

At the same time, Bill points out a reality we're faced with. As the
most widely deployed HTTP server, we have some sort of responsibility
(whether real or imagined) to the users not to "cut them off" if we can
avoid it. The point about distros taking their sweet time to update are
well taken - it's one of the reasons I always build from latest source.
Maybe there's a reason other than inertia for the slow adoption. Their
own lack of volunteer cycles? Configuration differences? Performance
differences? What we have works, so why change it?
Do we know those reasons enough to try to keep ahead of them?


P.S.
I'm not a Member or PMC... do I have access to the report that spurred
the conversation?

P.P.S.
Wow... I don't read my email for a few days...

Depends on what EOL means practically, of course. As someone whose day =

Yes.  The Monthly Board of Directors meeting minutes do become public.
All of the following ASF documents are a matter of public record;

http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/

and you'll find the _Board Calendar and Minutes_ as the fifth link listed on
that page.  Following through to the minutes, as of this moment, minutes
are only current up to March, several months ago, but that is because they
are reviewed by any officer attending and all board board member for errors
and omissions before they are approved at a subsequent meeting.  So this
will be 1-90 days out of sync, occasionally longer.

As far as our report submitted to the board each quarter - and included in
the foundation board minutes, the last published already was Feb '15, so
the subsequent one is last month, May '15 and should show up in another
month or two.  In theory, it isn't our report until 1. it is submitted, the
board
2. considers and 3. accepts the report at their meeting (a few weeks ago),
and 4. accepts the minutes of their meeting as recorded :)

So I'll let Eric share what he submitted for May on our behalf, but here
is the submitted/accepted/recorded report of Feb '15 - it's awfully high
level, so I'm not sure that updating dev@ regularly with the contents
offers a whole lot of benefit.  Thoughts?
