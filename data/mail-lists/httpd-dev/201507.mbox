Hi,

I wanted to CLOSE bug #57992 and #57993 as INVALID.

Strangely, they apparently have never been sent to bugs@httpd.apache.org 
(at least according to the mail archive I use)
Moreover, when I try to CLOSE them, I get an error, even if the state is 
correctly changed.

I don't really know who to send this report to... so here it is.

Best regards,
CJ

I've just become aware of this objection and would like to understand
the thinking behind it. Firstly, it seems strange to call this
"phoning home", a term that _usually_ means connecting to the vendor
of the s/w.

But more importantly, what harm is there in a server connecting to the
OCSP responders for the certificates it is serving? Why is this
"unacceptable"?

&gt; &gt;&gt; TIA for your comments!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m -1 on this, under the assumption that 2.4.x would eventua=
lly also<br>
&gt; &gt; turn it on by default (yes, I&#39;m aware of PR 50740, and CABF t=
rying to<br>
&gt; &gt; push this).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; While enabling it by default on trunk probably doesn&#39;t change=
 much<br>
&gt; (in<br>
&gt; &gt; my experience, very, very few people really compile and run trunk=
, I<br>
&gt; &gt; would even claim that this applies to http devs, too), I feel tha=
t<br>
&gt; the<br>
&gt; &gt; approach of &quot;let&#39;s turn it on by default and see how man=
y people run<br>
&gt; &gt; into problems&quot; (and bring them up on httpd-users etc.) isn&#=
39;t right.<br>
&gt; &gt; Those interested in achieving a more widespread use should<br>
&gt; specifically<br>
&gt; &gt; test OCSP stapling with mod_ssl, report their findings, file PRs =
on<br>
&gt; &gt; Bugzilla (and if possible, also submit suitable patches).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The fundamental objection I have to enabling stapling by default =
in<br>
&gt; our<br>
&gt; &gt; GA releases is that it would enable a &quot;phoning home&quot; fe=
ature (to the<br>
&gt; &gt; CA&#39;s OCSP responders) as a side effect of configuring a certi=
ficate.<br>
&gt; &gt; This is a setting I consider unacceptable for software published =
by<br>
&gt; the<br>
&gt; &gt; Apache HTTP Server project - the default must be opt-in, not opt-=
out.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve just become aware of this objection and would like to underst=
and<br>
&gt; the thinking behind it. Firstly, it seems strange to call this<br>
&gt; &quot;phoning home&quot;, a term that _usually_ means connecting to th=
e vendor<br>
&gt; of the s/w.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But more importantly, what harm is there in a server connecting to the=
<br>
&gt; OCSP responders for the certificates it is serving? Why is this<br>
&gt; &quot;unacceptable&quot;?<br>
<br>
</div></div>Because in many organizations it can&#39;t because of network /=

We can blow this away immediately?  I thought we were out of the business
of trying to keep external packages up-to-date.

Just to be sure I don't miss anything. This is not about disabling OCSP, its about disabling OCSP stapling by default.
Maybe I have a wrong understanding of OCSP stapling, but to me stapling only provides performance improvements, not
security improvements for the client as the client still could connect to the OCSP URL given in the cert directly and
get the answer from there. If the response is stabled it does not need to (with the same level of security) and saves
itself a roundtrip to the OCSP server of the CA and the OCSP server of the CA a request to process.

Again I don't get what this has to do with malware attacks on these organizations, but maybe my understanding of OCSP
stapling is entirely wrong.

This needs general cleanup and the "sandbox/test" parts need to go into =
a test setup, the rest of the sandbox will disappear. Basically, =
modules/http2/mod_h2 will become the modules/http2 (or modules/h2 =
(pls!)), some parts need to go into the acinclude.m4, others into docs.

I am volunteering to do this, when I can...

Yes, the client _could_ connect to the OCSP URL given in the cert 
directly and get the answer from there.  However, at least one major 
browser (Chrome) no longer does this, but it does process stapled OCSP 
responses.

Even if we could ignore Chrome...
There will always be some clients that cannot reach the CA's OCSP 
responder directly (due to connectivity issues at the client side), 
whereas the TLS servers that those clients connect to may well have 
better connectivity (and thus be able to staple OCSP responses that the 
client cannot obtain by any other means).

Also, this isn't just about performance.  If a client contacts an OCSP 
responder directly, it reveals to the CA that it is interested in a 
particular certificate.  That's a far worse privacy leak than a TLS 
server contacting a CA's OCSP responder and revealing that it's 
interested in the status of its own certificate!!

This was Ben's suggestion, top post.

At this project, the trunk of svn is the next major or minor version, e g
3.0 or 2.6 eventually, that would be after a 2.5 beta cycle to hash out the
kinks.

I'm strongly in favor of enabling this by default as a down-the-road
opportunity, and current concerns can be better addressed if everyone who
is touching that future 2.5.0+ version is looking at all issues that arise.

httpd 2.6/3.0 may well disable plaintext out-of-the-box, with a default tls
listener, sni named vhosts and http/2 enabled by default.  Ignoring
stapling due to enterprises that have no other reason to start supporting
ocsp and other modern validation and verification tools should not be a
primary goal, from the forward looking convention.

If it can't be solved with code, then it can always be changed back to
default of disabled before GA.

I know the SGA is done, thanks.  I was under the impression that an IP
Clearance statement/record is filed to general@i.a.o when that process is
complete.

As the VP Legal, you would know current process better than I :)

Thanks!  Hopefully others here can help with the process.  Perhaps a wiki
page to document low hanging fruit?

Hope everyone enjoyed a nice weekend, and a good holiday for those here in
the States!

On 2.4, one significant issue remains unsettled...

  *) mod_alias: Limit Redirect expressions to directory (Location) context
     and redirect statuses (implicit or explicit).
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/r1686853
                  http://svn.apache.org/r1686856
     2.4.x patch: trunk works (modulo CHANGES)
     +1: ylavic, jim

  *) Revert insufficiently thought-out mod_alias new expression feature
        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1663259
     +1: wrowe, jim
     [Mutually exclusive to multiple RedirectMatch patches proposed above,
     but entirely possible to vote for both or vote against either.
     [docs/manual .xml's require 'build all' regeneration]

Graham, as an original author back in January, you are in the best position
to review this fix for correctness.  Alternately, if someone is already
reviewing that patch and can complete, we can avoid backing out this
enhancement for a next attempt to T&R.  Backing it out is actually as
simple as a veto of the backport, but framed the choice as a vote to be
diplomatic.  I for one would support the backport once again after we've
successfully released a 2.4.next.

On 2.2, one significant issue remains unsettled...

  *) http: follow up to r1686271 (trunk) => r1686271 (2.4.x)
     Handle reentrance of state BODY_CHUNK_CR to avoid AH02901 when we eat
     BWS from multiple reads, and limit number of chunk-BWS to 10.
     trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/r1688536
                  http://svn.apache.org/r1688538
     2.2.x patch: trunk works
     +1: ylavic, wrowe

This one is a bit simpler to review, and mirrors what is already approved
on 2.4 branch.

I'm hoping to tag and roll 2.2 later this afternoon, and I recall Jim
suggesting he's itching to T&R 2.4 early this week, so just more one pair
of eyeballs could get us to that point.  If you can, my thanks to you in
advance.

Bill

I voted the revert, applied accepted backports, and updated tests
framework accordingly.
I guess both 2.4.16 and 2.2.30 could be T&R now.

However maybe the proposed backport about mod_reqtimeout (PR 56729) is
worth being included too, but that's not a showstopper.
It somehow made his way through 2.2.30 already (r1678698) but for
2.4.x this partial fix isn't enough (due to EOR handling).
Would be nice if it could be reviewed on time (my only vote so far...).

Dear fellow committers,

as some of you might already be aware, Jim and Eric punished my work on =
mod_h2 by checking in my code into httpd/trunk. And now they have given =
me committer access to clean up after them. Oh my.

I have read gazillions of wiki pages designed for newbies like me to =
keep me from actually doing commits...

But now I am almost ready. I have transformed the modules/http2 into =
something that compiles and runs my test cases here locally. I will =
tomorrow make some additional checks on my Ubuntu image and, should I =
not hear otherwise, commit the whole thing. I do not want to break =
anything. If you want me to to use a branch first, just let me know.

Cheers,

Stefan=20

Dear fellow committers,

as some of you might already be aware, Jim and Eric punished my work on =
mod_h2 by checking in my code into httpd/trunk. And now they have given =
me committer access to clean up after them. Oh my.

I have read gazillions of wiki pages designed for newbies like me to =
keep me from actually doing commits...

But now I am almost ready. I have transformed the modules/http2 into =
something that compiles and runs my test cases here locally. I will =
tomorrow make some additional checks on my Ubuntu image and, should I =
not hear otherwise, commit the whole thing. I do not want to break =
anything. If you want me to to use a branch first, just let me know.

Cheers,

Stefan=20

My only hint, if you can structure the commits to single purposes (e.g.
relocate files, then a commit to merge new testcases, etc...) that is
helpful.  In particular - split code changes from the general reorg so it
is easier to follow, much as you can see we split committing xml docs
source changes from the commit after regenerating the resulting xhtml docs.

Since it is a security related defect (not exploitable, ergo not a
vulnerability) I reviewed the 2.4 patch as well, thanks for pointing out
the discrepancy.

It appears that STATUS has been effectively resolved on both branches,
nothing significant that doesn't alter APIs/Directives in a significant way
is ignored, and we seem to be at a stable point for a T&R.  One nice patch
from Eric could use a vote/backport, but it is anything but critical.

Jim, please let us know if you plan to tag 2.4.16 Thursday morning?
Otherwise, I'll proceed to T&R in the early afternoon as I T&R 2.2.30 as
well.  With very sparse number of testers, I'm unwilling to wait for
Friday, particularly since patch review has been particularly sparse in the
community over the past month or few, and my own opportunity to review and
vote on both candidates is limited by travel for a friend's wedding.
Announcing these Monday - or Tuesday on the outside if there aren't
sufficient votes over the weekend, seems like a good thing for our users.

Bill

I need some help with establishing a test baseline. I checked out the =
test framework from  =
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/framework/trunk, followed =
the README and ran the tests against a freshly installed 2.4.x in =
/opt/httpd/2.4-plain. It did PASS with the default httpd.conf, but many =
tests were skipped due to modules missing.

I tried enable some more modules like mod_ssl or mod_rewrite and all of =
these attempts led to test failures and perl errors such as=20
"t/security/CVE-2011-3368-rewrite.t .. 1/3 # Failed test 1 in =
t/security/CVE-2011-3368-rewrite.t at line 13
Can't call method "print" on an undefined value at =
t/security/CVE-2011-3368-rewrite.t line 19.
"
My perl is the default Ubuntu 14.04 perl 5.18.

Is this a failure on my part or is the system supposed to operate like =
this? I am a bit confused...

Thanks for the help,

Hi,

in bug 57044, I proposed to use base64url for UNIQUE_ID. This means  
that the character '_' shall be used instead of '@', because '@' is  
not URL-safe. '_' is, and it may be used without percent-encoding in  
URLs, HTTP headers, or cookie values.

What do you think? Does anyone dare to commit the proposed patch (in  
trunk only) ?

Regards,
Michael

Hi Kaspar,

please could you find some time to review this patch?

I can say that both proposed patches (your and Jan's) are equivalent 
when it comes to implementation functionality. Unfortunately, I don't 
have the OpenSSL knowledge to comment the differences on technical 
level, but I would also like to see this functionality in the trunk :).

Regards,
Jan Kaluza

FYI: just checked in a modules/http2 that takes part in the build=20
process, similar options as mod_ssl

  --enable-h2
  --with-nghttp2=3D<path>

Tests were removed, so all sandbox/* is gone. Instead, I transformed my=20=

git mod_h2 into a repository with just the test setup and cases. If
interested, you may find it here: https://github.com/icing/mod_h2_test

So far, tested on OS X with event/worker/prefork. I had to make two=20
small changes, one for 421 handling and one for a pool threading issue
never observed on 2.4.

Added XML for directive description. Did not check in the generated
pages, as requested.

Again, as newbie in this project, please do not hesitate telling
me mistakes or advising me to do things in a different way. Thanks.

Some weeks ago the backporting of the ALPN patch was rejected as
a more generic approach was asked for.=20

Some hinted that an approach of defining a list of supported=20
"Protocols" per server/vhost and a general registry for some
callbacks where mod_ssl and mod_h2 would work with.

This and the 421 return code on mismatching host names are
the technical obstacles of backporting mod_h2 to 2.4, it seems.

Does someone feel like implementing such a thing? Shall I take
a stab at it? How should it best be approached? A separate core
module which stores things at its own server config? It needs
to fit into 2.4 somehow...


Have a nice weekend,

There is a repository, http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/ for all
test
resources that aren't part of the httpd tarballs/distribution.  It can
certainly
fit in a new mod_h2/trunk/ tree for the time being; if it were possible to
integrate it into
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/framework/trunk/
that would be excellent, as this is the regression test many of us perform
to initially validate potentially breaking changes.

I expect the behavior of mod_h2 to degrades over time, absent tests to
demonstrate correct behavior.

That was a small surprise, yes. Some checks in trunk did not like r->hostnam=

I agree. I was not sure about the test thing and how it's used. That is why I=
 put the tests in a githup repo for the time being.=20

my 2 cents, minimum to get it out of mod_ssl and support h2:

I don't think this should be in a separate module since the idea is
that this is the underlying list of app protocols the server will
speak --  just a new core (as in server/{core.c,protocol.c,request.c})
directive to set the protocol preference order in httpd.conf.
Extending the core_server_config is okay for backport
(apr_array_header_t of protocols supported and requested)

It would also need to track what protocols were supported by modules
at the VH level (I think this just means moving the mod_ssl optional
function for ALPN registration into the core)

It would need an API for a module like mod_ssl to tell the core the
protocols a client advertised, per-connection.

The core also probably needs to be the one that determines the one
negotiated protocol from the stuff above.

Finally, at least mod_ssl needs to know what was negotiated. A new
hook to tell anyone interested what was selected seems like overkill,
maybe mod_ssl just runs wherever it already does and calls some method
to get at the negotiated application protocol (based on conn_rec)

You can do an

svn mkdir https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/mod_h2
svn cp -r1690247 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/
http2/sandbox  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/mod_h2/trunk

to shift that all over to the test tree, perhaps integrate into
test/framework/ a bit later on if it's possible.

If you are hung up today, I'll go ahead and roll early this evening.  Looks
like zero churn for the past couple weeks, a bit of bug fixing and

The pre-release test tarballs for Apache httpd 2.4.16 can be found
at the usual place:

	http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/

I'm calling a VOTE on releasing these as Apache httpd 2.4.16 GA.

[ ] +1: Good to go
[ ] +0: meh
[ ] -1: Danger Will Robinson. And why.

Vote will last the normal 72 hrs.

NOTE: The *-deps are only there for convenience.

Thx!

PS: Hopefully, 4th time's the charm!

I typically use the default config from fresh build I do with configure 
flags --enable-modules=reallyall and --enable-load-all-modules.

I don't get failures as described by you above. I typically run the perl 
framework with perl plus locally installed modules. To instal modules as 
a normal user separate from the system installed perl I use local::lib. 
The stuff I add is Bundle::ApacheTest and recent versions of 
Test::Harness, Crypt::SSLeay, Net:SSLeay, IO::Socket::SSL, 
LWP::Protocol::https, HTTP::DAV (plus whatever cpan automatically adds 
as further dependencies). The list probably could be shortened, but 
that's the cruft I accumulated over time. When building the HTTPS/SSL 
parts one must be careful to use the same OpenSSL version that one uses 
to build the web server. Sometimes this is a bit tricky.

The failure in line 19 you describe happens at the end of the following 
snippet:

my $sock = Apache::TestRequest::vhost_socket();
ok $sock && $sock->connected;

my $req = "GET @"."localhost/foobar.html HTTP/1.1\r\n".
    "Host: " . Apache::TestRequest::hostport() . "\r\n".
     "\r\n";

ok $sock->print($req);

So it seems $sock is not defined. And indeed the failure in line 13 is 
the ok check in the second code line above. So the test could not 
connect to the vhost.

Using t/TEST (try help or -help or -h to see the options) you can also 
just start the web server configured for the tests without immediately 
running them. You can then try to connect yourself.

You can also edit LogLevel in Apache-Test/lib/Apache/TestConfig.pm and 
increase it before the perl Makefile.PL and the t/TEST to get more log 
output.

Not likely but maybe your system openssl is used by perl and can't 
connect to a vhost powered by some other OpenSSL that you build your web 
server against?

The vhost_socket() used by the test is defined in 
lib/Apache/TestRequest.pm as:

sub vhost_socket {
     my $module = shift;
     local $Apache::TestRequest::Module = $module if $module;

     my $hostport = hostport(Apache::Test::config());

     my($host, $port) = split ':', $hostport;
     my(%args) = (PeerAddr => $host, PeerPort => $port);

     if ($module and $module =~ /ssl/) {
         require Net::SSL;
         local $ENV{https_proxy} ||= ""; #else uninitialized value in 
Net/SSL.pm
         return Net::SSL->new(%args, Timeout => UA_TIMEOUT);
     }
     else {
         require IO::Socket;
         return IO::Socket::INET->new(%args);
     }
}

Maybe you can add some debug output to STDOUT there to see to which 
socket it tries to connect and where it fails.

Finally: any locally active pieces of security software intercepting the 
connect?

Regards,

Rainer

You're right, an ASN1_OBJECT * as an argument for modssl_X509_getSAN
makes handling of otherName entries relatively awkward. In the attached
patch, I have switched to a string for specifying the requested
otherName form (similar to what you did in your patch).

OBJ_create adds new entries to a process-wide table, so instead of
checking for the presence of a specific entry at each request (in
parse_otherName_value), I consider it more appropriate and efficient to
do this only once, in ssl_init_Module.

Barring feedback against this approach (or the observation of bugs in
the implementation), I intend to commit it to trunk in the next few days
(including mod_ssl.xml changes and a CHANGES item).

It's unacceptable for at least two reasons: a) by default, an HTTP
server is supposed to process *incoming* requests, not make accidental
outgoing connections in addition (at least not unless it's explicitly
instructed to do so); b) there's no statement in our license with an
explicit caveat on such a side effect ("when relying on our default
settings, configuring a site with an SSL server certificate may result
in unsolicited outgoing HTTP requests" - and no, I do not want to see
our license amended by things like that).

I maintain my objection to uncommenting "#SSLUseStapling On" in our
default config in httpd-ssl.conf.in - and for the record, also to
changing code, be that in ssl_engine_config.c:modssl_ctx_init() or
elsewhere. Those keen on enabling it by default on behalf of the users
("because we know what is good for you") are free to lobby with the OS
vendors to have their package defaults changed.

We can have a dialog about the best behavior of our default config.
However...

Our License says nothing about accepting requests, either.  Licenses
don't express these mechanics.  They define the terms for users to
"reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
perform,
sublicense, and distribute" the work and its derivatives, and the
corresponding
patent rights as well.

A number of ASF works are servers.  A number are clients.  A number are
both clients and servers.  OCSP is hardly an accidental request, any more
than
the proxy module requests.  And in forwarding requests to https proxy
servers,
(another side effect) verifying the OCSP identity of the connected server
is
hardly an unexpected side effect, it's a characteristic of the protocol
(that
backend *server* advertised OCSP validation - stapled or indirect, and that
the *user* configured the certificate for OCSP validation).  Third party
OCSP
validation is so problematic that OCSP stapling is a blindly obvious
enhancement
that will far offset the routing configuration issues it also inspires

So your premise above is, well, outright silly.

You are welcome to object, and I think Ben's reply here to your thoughts
and observations, particularly your early one, since he is advocating for
this
change and this would move the dialog along to a conclusion.

Contrawise, httpd project can do the 'right thing' from our perspective,
and
the downstream distributors can correspondingly disable it.

Moreso, any enterprise so affected already is configuring httpd to their own
organization's standards and policies.

If you are suggesting we shouldn't change the compiled-in default, I can
agree, POLS (Principal Of Least Surprise).  If you are suggesting the
default
config shouldn't reflect the ability to efficiently handle OCSP by
stapling, here
I think we would disagree.

Not to anyone in particular:

Contacting the OCSP responder may indeed be a surprise, and it might not
even work due to to firewall rules being effectively surprised.  (DNS was
too once upon a time.)  It does require education on the part of some
administrators.  But:

No changes discussed actually change the behavior for any non-hypothetical
configuration, since SSL is not configured by default and no existing
configurations will magically start contacting the responder.  (The more
nuanced wording of "OCSP stapling by default" is "IFF you're using the
latest httpd default configuration files, an OCSP responder pointed to in a
certificate you configure will be utilized, unless you say otherwise.").

The config change does move the key decision point regarding this new
concept to the basic enablement of SSL.  In retrospect, it might have been
wise to enable/disable stapling on the SSLCertificateFile directive, both
for the more granular control as well as making the admin see the setting
when performing that required bit of configuration.

I had several people contact me recently about broken Apache installation
where the issue was actually with Chrome (I think starting with 43).
When a system has IP-based vhosts on 127.0.0.0/8 besides 127.0.0.1 and uses
the hostname anything.localhost, Chrome will no longer load those pages.
This is their change:
https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455825

This is not an HTTPD-specific issue, but I could see it being included
either in the documentation or as a startup warning if there are vhosts
ending in .localhost.
Before I start writing/coding, I was wondering whether others think it is
worth it?

- Y

This something I can agree with: Leave the default compiled in to off and in the configuration distributed by us have it
set to on.

Subject: Helping out with release testing
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi devs,

As each release goes by I see the same few people involved with testing. It 
seems like a lot of work and I would like to help spread the load a little. 
Is it only committers than can participate in this process or do you invite 
help from others?

I can help test on the "common" platforms, viz. CentOS 7, Mac OSX 10.10.4 
and Debian, which I see a number of people already test. However, if me 
testing on those platforms may free up their time to test on other more 
exotic systems that I do not have access to, I am very happy to do so.

Please let me know how I can help out.

Sincerely,
Kean

Anyone is free to test and help out, and frankly, we'd highly appreciate 
it if you did :).
As for the voting; Anyone can vote on a release, but only committers can 
cast binding votes.
Having said that, if anyone - even a non-committer - casts a -1, it WILL 
cause us to pause and think about it, discuss etc.

We value input from our users, and anyone that can help out test a 
release will have our thanks and respect, and your opinions and findings 
WILL be taken into consideration.

With regards,
Daniel.

            As each release goes by I see the same few people involved
            with testing. It seems like a lot of work and I would like
            to help spread the load a little. Is it only committers than

            I can help test on the "common" platforms, viz. CentOS 7,
            Mac OSX 10.10.4 and Debian, which I see a number of people
            already test. However, if me testing on those platforms may
            free up their time to test on other more exotic systems that
            I do not have access to, I am very happy to do so.<br

Strictly speaking, it is  PMC members votes that are binding. But this
is almost meaningless from a quality perspective and the distinction
shouldn't dissuade anyone from testing candidates when they can.

There is actually an ambiguity in our policy on that. We should fix it ;)

modules you listed, cleaned the test conf, rebuild the httpd with =
reallyreallyall modules and now the tests are running *almost* fine.

I get 31 failures in modules/access.t and, frankly, cannot figure out =
what is wrong on my system. This seem basic grant/deny tests.
Test Summary Report
-------------------
t/modules/access.t                (Wstat: 0 Tests: 408 Failed: 31)
  Failed tests:  4, 20-21, 24, 26, 28, 30, 38, 55, 72, 89
                106-107, 123-124, 141, 154, 168, 170, 175
                192, 209, 226, 277, 290, 304, 306, 311
                328, 345, 362
Files=3D110, Tests=3D4312, 72 wallclock secs ( 1.69 usr  0.17 sys + =
32.46 cusr  8.66 csys =3D 42.98 CPU)
Result: FAIL
Failed 1/110 test programs. 31/4312 subtests failed.

Since it matches the remote ip/host, it must be something in my name =
resolution, I assume? Does that ring a bell with anyone?

PS. Btw. to eventually be helpful, I switched testing from trunk to the =
2.4.16. Same access errors, but everything else runs. (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS =
x86_64)

If you are using something like a hostname of foo.localdomain (or
whatever), make sure that /etc/hosts has that resolving to 127.0.0.1

Have you worked out that it's safe to do that call there?  It looks odd 
to do that there rather than alongside other global cleanups in 
ssl_cleanup_pre_config, so it's at least worth a comment if you really 
want this here.

There is some complicated interaction between EVP_cleanup() and 
OBJ_cleanup() which I haven't tried to decipher, but it looks like 
EVP_cleanup() will actually do the cleanup call?

Ok, narrowing it down, but not done yet. Problem is as follows:

1 with 'localhost' as servername, tests were failing with "waiting for =
server to warm up", although server was reachable as =
http://localhost:8529/
  strange.
2 with 'test.example.org' as servername and entry in /etc/hosts =
everything works except modules/access.t with 31 failures.
  After reading that code, I see that
  a) mod_access_compat makes a reverse lookup if it thinks the =
deny/allow is a host name and lookups are allowed.=20
  b) HostnameLookups is 'Off' in the test config
  c) /etc/hosts does not enable reverse lookups for the resolver (at =
least not on ubuntu/osx)

So, it seems to me you all are testing with "127.0.0.1" or enable =
lookups and have a name from a DNS zone with proper reverse. Everything =
else should not work.=20

//Stefan (needs a drink)

PS. And yes, 2.4.16 seems to work on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Subject: [VOTE] Release Apache httpd 2.4.16 as GA

The pre-release test tarballs for Apache httpd 2.4.16 can be found
at the usual place:

http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/

I'm calling a VOTE on releasing these as Apache httpd 2.4.16 GA.

[ ] +1: Good to go
[ ] +0: meh
[ ] -1: Danger Will Robinson. And why.

Vote will last the normal 72 hrs.

NOTE: The *-deps are only there for convenience.

Thx!

PS: Hopefully, 4th time's the charm!

[X] +1: Good to go

Test suite passed with prefork and event on:

CentOS 7 64-bit
FreeBSD 10.1, 32-bit, kernel accept filter not loaded
Fedora 22, 64-bit
Ubuntu 12, 32-bit*
Ubuntu 15, 32-bit*

*silly failure of t/filter/case.t due to an expected Perl doc file not
being installed

Of course it is not === 2.4.16, but today's 2.4.17-dev with mod_proxy_scgi
and a few Django apps works fine for me in a real deployment on Ubuntu 12.

Thanks for RM-ing, Jim!  Thanks everyone for your help testing, especially
non-committers!

+1 to release and thank a bunch for RMing.

In short: No regressions found.

Detailed report:

- Sigs and hashes OK
- contents of tarballs identical
- contents of tag and tarballs identical
   except for expected deltas
   (we could cleanup some m4 files in apr-util/xml/expat/conftools
    at the end of buildconf, no regression)

Built on

- Solaris 8+10 Sparc as 32 Bit Binaries
- SLES 10+11 (64 Bits)
- RHEL 6 (64 Bits)

For all platforms built

- with default (shared), shared and static modules
- with module sets none, few, most, all, reallyall and default
   (always mod_privileges disabled)
- using --enable-load-all-modules
- against "included" APR/APU from deps tarball,
   plus external APR/APU 1.5.2/1.5.4

- using external libraries
   - expat 2.1.0
   - pcre 8.37
   - openssl 1.0.2c
   - lua 5.2.4
   - distcache 1.5.1
   - libxml2 2.9.2

- Tool chain:
     - platform gcc except for Solaris
       (gcc 4.1.2 for Solaris 8 and 4.9.2 for Solaris 10)
     - CFLAGS: -O2 -g -Wall -fno-strict-aliasing
               (and -mpcu=v9 on Solaris)

All builds succeeded
   - one compiler warning
ssl/ssl_util_stapling.c:657: warning: 'ok' may be used uninitialized in 
this function

Tested for

- Solaris 8+10 (32), SLES 10+11 (64), RHEL 6 (64)
- MPMs prefork, worker, event
   (except event on Solaris8, unsupported)
- default, shared and static modules
- log levels info, debug and trace8
- module set reallyall (121 modules plus MPMs)

The following test failures were seen:

a Test 4 or 5 in t/modules/dav.t:
   Happens for 37 out of 378 runs.
   Creation, modified and now times not in the correct order.
   This seems to be a system issue, all tests done on NFS,
   many tested on virtualized guests.
   Not a regression.

b Various tests in t/apache/expr_string.t: (6, 11, 14, 17, 20 ,23)
   Happens for 74 out of 378 runs (almost all on SLES 10, 14 on RHEL6
   3 on Solaris 8 and 2 on Solaris 10).
   The failure is always on line 68, where the error_log contents
   are checked.
   Not a regression.

c Tests 55-57 of t/modules/cgi.t testing contents of ScriptLog.
   Likely similar than what I observed for 2.4.12.
   Fix probably by porting r1651085 from mod_cgi to mod_cgid.
   Not a regression.

d One failure in test 60 of t/ssl/proxy.t.
   This was due to a timeout during a reverse proxy call
   and I can see from the log, that the system was just
   a bit too slow so it triggered the timeout.
   There was more activity going on on the system besides
   httpd testing so this failure looks tolerable to me.

Regards,

Rainer

Testing with localhost here.

No precise idea here about your problem, but

- make sure you don't have any proxy shell environment variables set 
(http_proxy, https_proxy or similar)

- we might get an idea if we can see your /etc/hosts and 
/etc/resolv.conf (cleared from private info).

+1 to release, thanks for RMing

Details:

- Netware and Windows binary artefacts not checked (missing)
- signature and hashes OK
- key in KEYS file
- gz and bz2 contents identical
- no unexpected diff to svn tag
- built and tested on
   - Solaris 8+10 Sparc
   - Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10+11 (64 Bit)
   - RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 (64Bit)
- builds fine using gcc (209 different build combinations)
   - out of tree
   - with "all", "most" and default module sets
   - with either default (static) or shared linked modules
   - MPMs prefork, worker, event (where applicable)
   - dependencies apr/apu/expat/pcre:
     a) all bundled
     b) 1.5.2/1.5.4/2.1.0/8.37 (2 variants)
   - OpenSSL 1.0.2c
- one build warning: lex.ssl_expr_yy.c:1460:
   warning: ‘input’ defined but not used
   - I expect configure to still fail on Linux with external non-system
     PCRE. Not a regression, see my 2.2.23 voting mail for details.
- test suite ran for the builds with module set "all" and log levels
     info and debug (168 variations)
   - no test regressions w.r.t. at least 2.2.16-2.2.29:
     - Failed test 2 in t/ssl/extlookup.t at line 27
     - Failed test 9 in t/ssl/require.t at line 44
     Happens always.
     For details about both see my 2.2.19 voting mail.
   - failed tests 2+3 in t/security/CVE-2008-2364.t when
     using LWP 6.0.3 or above
     Happens always.
     For details about both see my 2.2.23 voting mail.
   - Test 4 in t/modules/dav.t:
     Happens for 19 out of 168 runs.
     Creation, modified and now times not in the correct order.
     This seems to be a system issue, all tests done on NFS,
     many tested on virtualized guests.
     Likely similar than what I observed for 2.4.
   - Tests 55-57 of t/modules/cgi.t testing contents of ScriptLog.
     Happens for 60 out of 168 runs.
     Likely similar than what I observed for 2.4.
     Fix probably by porting r1651085 from mod_cgi to mod_cgid.

Regards,

Rainer

I'm running into a problem with mod_proxy_balancer unable to find 
ap_proxy_set_scoreboard_lb on Windows.

I reverted my build to 2.2.29 to make sure it wasn't me and 2.2.29 
completed, and then I looked at the 2.2.30 changes and see this function 
call was a new addition.

I'm planning on going back and setting my environment back up with 
2.2.30 tomorrow, but thought I should mention this now in case it's 
obvious to someone.

Thanks,
Andy

There is possibly a missing PROXY_DECLARE for ap_proxy_set_scoreboard_lb.

Maybe the attached patch helps?

After 72+ hours, and with all +1 votes (more than 3 of which
were binding) and no -1 votes, I call this vote CLOSED with
a result that the vote PASSES!

Thx to all testers and committers!

I will start the push of the tarballs to the mirrors.

  [+1]  Release 2.2.30 GA (apr 1.5.2, apr-util 1.5.4)


The PROXY_DECLARE bug doesn't seem to be a showstopper, the announce can
make note of that fix.

With that issue addressed, this is my +1 for release.


Pushing to the mirrors ASAP.
Bill

3 of the +1s were cast before the problem was noted.

I think that makes sense.  If you've already gone through the 
contortions of build from source on Windows, and you can't figure out 
how to apply a patch, I don't know what to tell you :)

Thanks,

I misread Jeff's vote this morning (my appologies), and \retract my +1
based on his concerns. I'm withdrawing this release from consideration (and
it had not yet traveled to mirrors)

I will prepare a single patch 2.2.31 based on this fix alone and resubmit
to the group later today for an expedited 24 hour release vote, given that
the delta is easily re-validated by existing reviewers..

Bill

OK. Case solved. test/framework/trunk found hardly innocent:

On my Parallels Ubuntu image, the lines

127.0.0.1     localhost
::1	      localhost

existed. But the httpd.conf which is generated by t/TEST does a

Listen 0.0.0.0:8529

which is a mix of ipv4/ipv6 that causes the startup to wait
indefinitely for localhost to warm up. I assume the checks
are done on ::1 and never answered.

Removing the ::1 line from /etc/hosts solved the problem.

On the other hand, If one replaces the "Listen 0.0.0.0:port"=20
with "Listen port" and adds the ::1 line again to /etc/hosts,
the startup problems are also gone.=20

But the access.t tests now fail.

So, something has to give. I think the tests should work
in the presence of ipv6 nowadays. I definitely think that
the Listen should be done with port only.

PS. This was a plain vanilla ubuntu 14.04 lts install. nothing fancy =
added.

Hi Jim,

This commit breaks our website, since the mirror they are directed to may
or may not contain the current advertised 2.4.12 based on exactly when that
specific mirror rsync's.

Please hold off 24 hours before committing the svn rm side of the svn mv in
the future... so that mirrors still host the image that we are currently
advertising?  Thx,

Bill

Subject: building httpd 2.2 on windows automation question.
Message-ID: <55A52947.90408@ptc.com>

I wanted to just send a quick email out to see if anyone is familiar 
enough with the windows compile process to see if there are any thoughts 
on how to improve what I'm doing.

So a few quick points
1) i'm using the unix source to prep the source tree
2) i'm not using any external makefiles/visual studio project files
the intent of my build is to be able to build httpd with no dependencies 
on anything but the httpd project and official vanilla dependencies 
(openssl, zlib).

I'm currently automating MOST of my build using a cygwin bash script to 
prep my source tree.

What I end up doing after this is manual steps based on posts and advice 
I've seen on the httpd mailing list as well as apachelounge forums:
1) first open the dsw in visual studio 8 and convert it to a new sln 
project - apparently something to do with visual studio 10 conversion 
doesn't work
2) open in visual studio 10 and convert to a visual studio 10 sln file.
3) build the project

I'm pretty sure #3 can simply be done with nmake, but I'm not sure, but 
since I'm already in the visual studio project as a result of #2 i'd 
never bothered to try.

My main question is does anyone know how to automate 1 and 2 in a way 
that can be done via a script?  It would greatly increase the efficiency 
of my build if I don't have to monitor it occasionally.

The cmake process for 2.4 is pretty nice :)  one .sh script kicks that 
off thanks to help received from Jeff.

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Andy,

at least for the 2.4 there is a script on github [1]

Maybe you can adopt that for 2.2. I wonder why you still want 2.2.
Unless you use some exotic modules that do no build with 2.4,  2.4 is
the better option.

I should add that I've done a little big of digging into MS 
documentation and googling, and I think there is no way around a manual 
dsw-sln conversion.

devenv.com has a /Upgrade option that will probably do #2 for me , but I 
don't think there's a way around the dsw to sln conversion.

So I'm asking on here hoping maybe someone had a bright idea that worked :)

Thanks,
Andy

2.4 doesn't need to use the dsw/sln projects as it can use cmake, so 
yeah, I already have a script for 2.4.  We are also using 2.4, but have 
legacy products using 2.2 that need to be kept up to date and an update 
to 2.4 would be too disruptive.. enterprise .. yadayadayada :)

Thanks,
Andy

Well,i just figured out #2 and #3

devenv /upgrade Apache.sln
devenv /build Release /project InstallBin

So just the dsw to sln conversion/save is manual now.

Nor should it be :)
Not for 2.2 at least.

Honestly, I'd like to get all our customers on 2.2 to 2.4 asap.  It 
would save me time and energy, but I know it ain't happening anytime soon.

FYI, the start of the thread about EOL'ing 2.2 ALMOST got me enough 
momentum to make the change.

So right now, the most I can do to make my life easier is to make the 
2.2 build process as invisible as possible.

You know 2.2 has .mak files in the source. They've been given no love in 
a long time but nothing major has changed for them to need it AFAIK. 
Those should make your automating life simple.
nmake /f makefile.win [options] installr

I was never able to get the ootb Makefile.win to work with a modern 
visual studio.  I just tried and this occurs:

         link.exe -lib @C:\Users\runtime\AppData\Local\Temp\nm9E02.tmp
         "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 
10.0\VC\BIN\nmake.exe" -
nologo -f libaprutil.mak      CFG="libaprutil - Win32 Release" RECURSE=0
         if not exist ".\Release/" mkdir ".\Release"
         tempfile.bat
libaprutil.mak(1494) : fatal error U1054: cannot create inline file 
'tempfile.ba
t'
Stop.
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual 
Studio 10.0
\VC\BIN\nmake.exe"' : return code '0x2'
Stop.
NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual 
Studio 10.0
\VC\BIN\nmake.exe"' : return code '0x2'
Stop.

I remember an e-mail thread with you about building the makefile and dep 
files and how they weren't actually in the unix source and there were 
gaps where the windows source wasn't updated - which is why I needed to 
figure out how to build from the vanilla unix sources.  Did this change? 
Because I could swear the unix sources didn't have some of this stuff 
before.

Entirely my fault, I was in sync with progress to late last evening, and
skimmed the morning thread.  No objections to reworking the release,
although my schedule keeps getting interrupted.

Later this evening it will be ready for review.

I've run into this on VC11/Win7x64 more than once. I think I just 
restarted the build again and it has always gone through. Microsoft says 
a tempfile.bat already exists with a read-only attribute so it evidently 
has started creating the file before removing the prior one.

I was evidently wrong, I'm looking at httpd-2.2.29.tar.gz as well as the 
2.2.30 tag and I see them there.  The .dep for mod_ssl is locked to 
OpenSSL <= 0.9.8 but that is an easy fix and done with r1691074. I 
believe the Windows build is CTR.

I ran builds of 2.2.head using the included mak files and Yann's patch, 
all went well on VC9/Vista, VC10/2003r2 & VC11/Win7x64.

Give it another try with 2.2.31 when it arrives, hopefully tomorrow.

It seems that httpd.a.o still refers to 2.4.12, whereas 2.4.16
effectively reached www.a.o/dist/httpd and mirrors (leading to 2.4.16
not being visible and 2.4.12 issuing 404s).

           Apache HTTP Server 2.4.16 Released

The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project
are pleased to announce the release of version 2.4.16 of the Apache
HTTP Server ("Apache").  This version of Apache is our latest GA
release of the new generation 2.4.x branch of Apache HTTPD and
represents fifteen years of innovation by the project, and is
recommended over all previous releases. This release of Apache is
principally a security, feature and bug fix release. NOTE: versions
2.4.13, 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 were not released.

CVE-2015-3183 (cve.mitre.org)
core: Fix chunk header parsing defect.
Remove apr_brigade_flatten(), buffering and duplicated code from
the HTTP_IN filter, parse chunks in a single pass with zero copy.
Limit accepted chunk-size to 2^63-1 and be strict about chunk-ext
authorized characters.

CVE-2015-3185 (cve.mitre.org)
Replacement of ap_some_auth_required (unusable in Apache httpd 2.4)
with new ap_some_authn_required and ap_force_authn hook.

CVE-2015-0253 (cve.mitre.org)
core: Fix a crash with ErrorDocument 400 pointing to a local URL-path 
with the INCLUDES filter active, introduced in 2.4.11. PR 57531. 

CVE-2015-0228 (cve.mitre.org)
mod_lua: A maliciously crafted websockets PING after a script
calls r:wsupgrade() can cause a child process crash. 

Also in this release are some exciting new features including:

*) Better default recommended SSLCipherSuite and SSLProxyCipherSuite
*) mod_proxy_scgi: ProxySCGIInternalRedirect now allows an alternate
  response header to be used by the application
*) Event MPM improvements
*) Various mod_proxy_* improvements
*) mod_log_config: Add "%{UNIT}T" format to output request duration in
  seconds, milliseconds or microseconds depending on UNIT ("s", "ms",
  "us")

We consider this release to be the best version of Apache available, and
encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache HTTP Server 2.4.16 is available for download from:

http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

Apache 2.4 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
boosts over the 2.2 codebase.  For an overview of new features
introduced since 2.4 please see:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/new_features_2_4.html

Please see the CHANGES_2.4 file, linked from the download page, for a
full list of changes. A condensed list, CHANGES_2.4.16 includes only
those changes introduced since the prior 2.4 release.  A summary of all 
of the security vulnerabilities addressed in this and earlier releases 
is available:

http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html

This release requires the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) version 1.5.x
and APR-Util version 1.5.x. The APR libraries must be upgraded for all
features of httpd to operate correctly.

This release builds on and extends the Apache 2.2 API.  Modules written
for Apache 2.2 will need to be recompiled in order to run with Apache
2.4, and require minimal or no source code changes.

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/VERSIONING

When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please bear in mind
that if you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs (other
than the Prefork MPM), you must ensure that any modules you will be
using (and the libraries they depend on) are thread-safe.

Gave it a try with the patched 2.2.31, and you're right, continuing on 
gets around the error.  It does occur about half a dozen times though. 
I'll have to script that in if this works.

The openssl problem bit me though.  And it looks like that change you 
mentioned will do it too.  Haven't patched it yet.

Thanks for pointing this out.

...got the test framework to PASS on my OS X against httpd/trunk built.

I added more description of what I found in the README and checked that =
in. I have the attached patch to the test code itself, which I will not =
just dump on you. I think the changes are ok, but will wait for some =
feedback.

The changes are in
- t/modules/cgi.t
- t/modules/include.t
- t/security/CVE-2004-0747.t

Cheers,

  Stefan

The pre-release candidate tarballs of Apache httpd 2.2.31, can be found in;

        http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/

  +/-1
  [  ]  Release 2.2.31 GA (apr 1.5.2, apr-util 1.5.4)

Win32 src to follow in an hour this round. With such an insignificant
set of changes to a generally approved 2.2.30 which enjoyed the full
3-day voting period, I expect to end this vote tomorrow at 17:00GMT
Thursday, if there are sufficient votes cast.

The entire delta between 2.2.30 and 2.2.31 is attached, for your initial
inspection.

[X]  Release 2.2.31 GA (apr 1.5.2, apr-util 1.5.4)

The diffs look good to me.

I ran the test suite on FreeBSD 10 and obtained the same results as with 
2.2.29 and 2.2.30.

Thanks!

Hi all,

since 2.4.10 and 2.2.29 the announce@httpd.apache.org is abandoned. Is this
intentional?

Someone already asked about this last year:
http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=141157921203967&w=2

If this is not the right list to ask this question, where should it be
addressed then?

b.

PS: Congrats for finally successful 2.4.16 release :)

Hello everybody,

I would be very grateful if somebody could look into bug report 58118
https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58118

The issue concerns the logging of a 503 status code in 
modules/proxy/mod_proxy_fcgi.c at 836 although a 200 has been sent to 
the client. This can happen if the user aborts the connection while 
mod_proxy_fcgi reads the chunked response from the backend.

I appended a patch to this issue, maybe it is worth to be considered.

Thank you in advance!

Kind regards,
Tobias Adolph

I am a bit behind - yet looking forward.

I wish to recall a pleasant get together last April in Texas just before
ApacheCon. At that time I mentioned LibreSSL and building httpd against it
(actually mod_ssl is all it amounts to).

The build itself was quite simple - I shall repeat that now for 2.4.16 and
trunk - and send the 'patch' in.

While build is simple - understanding the differences in test output is
daunting.

Here I have the output of just one test t/ssl/pr12355.t - and note the
differences in the ssl_access_log - not just the error messages (I have
removed all "debug" messages from the logs as they were "in the way".

LibreSSL is version 2.2.0, OpenSSL is version 0.9.8m (yes I know very old,
will test with latest patches later - I hope not relevant to here).

So, please note: LibreSSL says access is:
t/logs/ssl_request_log:[16/Jul/2015:11:47:12 +0000] 127.0.0.1 - - "POST
/require-sha-cgi/perl_echo.pl HTTP/1.1" 403 237
while OpenSSL says
t/logs/ssl_request_log:[16/Jul/2015:11:32:35 +0000] 127.0.0.1 TLSv1 RC4-SHA
"POST /require-sha-cgi/perl_echo.pl HTTP/1.1" 200 11

My question: what can I do to understand why OpenSSL is adding TLSv1
RC4-SHA while LibreSSL is "- -"

Note also in the

*Observation*: I am guessing the test is failing because the renegotiation
is failing because it is downgrading to "(near) export quality" - which
many recent CVE are reporting as "very bad".
Maybe, this fail is a false "FAIL" - that 0.9.8 will always PASS because
that is what 0.9.8 does.

*Last question*: IF you think this failure is because the renegotiation is
requesting something is bad - *then it would seem the server is responding
as it should* - and the test needs correction. Otherwise - some help with
moving forward is appreciated!

First little thing I ran into - that I did not have with 2.4.12 is this:

root@x065:[/data/prj/apache/httpd/test]/opt/httpd/sbin/apachectl start
AH00534: httpd: Configuration error: More than one MPM loaded.

Granted, I should perhaps change to pre-fork (I noticed some had only
tested that) - but I had 'adopted' MPM when 2.4.0 first came out.

root@x065:[/data/prj/apache/httpd/test]grep -i mpm /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

LoadModule mpm_worker_module libexec/mod_mpm_worker.so
# Server-pool management (MPM specific)
#Include /etc/httpd/extra/httpd-mpm.conf

p.s. I had done configure with:

  $ ./configure --enable-layout=AIX --with-apr=/opt/bin/apr-1-config
--with-apr-util=/opt/bin/apu-1-config --enable-mpms-shared=all

I do not know why both are there - something to do with the "configure"
statement perhaps. As I said above - not had this show up before.

In any case, just finished ApacheTest and is looking very good.

All tests successful.
Files=110, Tests=4843, 364 wallclock secs ( 3.38 usr  0.50 sys + 88.88 cusr
74.02 csys = 166.78 CPU)
Result: PASS
[warning] server loopback:8529 shutdown
[warning] port 8529 still in use...
......done

Looks correct...

--enable-mpms-shared=all
Worked as instructed...

--enable-load-all-modules
Did just as you asked.

Not sure offhand if we can hack some mpm-specific module exception to the
later.

My comment is that with 2.4.12 the same configure did not do this. This is
new behavior.

I was testing with 2.4.12 all day yesterday, using the same build scripts
today with 2.4.16 came up differently.

So now, after the build I have this difference in httpd.conf

Nothing serious of course - AND the advantage is that I do not have to do a
new build to switch to pre-fork (which was the old way iirc).

So - was I the first to find a bug in the new release :P

btw - I am much more interested in the ssl tests and whether it is a failed
test (going back to MC4 128-bit) when the initial connection was much
better. I assume this is not logjam (or some other horrible recent OpenSSL
TLS renegotiate CVE) - but it is something we want to prevent (as far as I
know LibreSSL has no support for RC4 as it is too weak - hence these will
fail by definition if the test (client) is forcing a renegotiate to that
level of cryptography (key exchange?).

In other words - think more about my other post please!

I really should have titled this differently - sigh!

The test framework does indeed use RC4-MD5 (vs RC4-SHA) on location
/require-md5-cgi (resp. /require-sha-cgi) for renegotiations based on
cipher change.

I have replace it with AES128 vs AES256 (-SHA) in r1691419, these
should be available with both libs.
Could you svn up your framework and check if it works now?

Exactly, thats mostly a flag to produce non-production bus test ready 
configs. Not so nice that it doesn't startup, but I would be astonished 
if there were people running into this problem and not being on this 
list here.

Moving this to a thread with a better title!

A longish read - basically while 2.4.12 had few errors when built 
against OpenSSL 0.9.8 LibreSSL has quite a few errors - perhaps because 
it has removed many "unsafe" crypto combinations. The root question is: 
is this LibreSSL misbehaving, or are the tests needing some work to 
verify that "weak ciphers and key exchanges are not being used - e.g., 
via renegotiation.

+++

I wish to recall a pleasant get together last April in Texas just before
ApacheCon. At that time I mentioned LibreSSL and building httpd against it
(actually mod_ssl is all it amounts to).

The build itself was quite simple - I shall repeat that now for 2.4.16 and
trunk - and send the 'patch' in.

While build is simple - understanding the differences in test output is
daunting.

Here I have the output of just one test t/ssl/pr12355.t - and note the
differences in the ssl_access_log - not just the error messages (I have
removed all "debug" messages from the logs as they were "in the way".

LibreSSL is version 2.2.0, OpenSSL is version 0.9.8m (yes I know very old,
will test with latest patches later - I hope not relevant to here).

So, please note: LibreSSL says access is:

while OpenSSL says

My question: what can I do to understand why OpenSSL is adding TLSv1
RC4-SHA while LibreSSL is "- -"

*Observation*: I am guessing the test is failing because the renegotiation
is failing because it is downgrading to "(near) export quality" - which
many recent CVE are reporting as "very bad".
Maybe, this fail is a false "FAIL" - that 0.9.8 will always PASS because
that is what 0.9.8 does.

*Last question*: IF you think this failure is because the renegotiation is
requesting something is bad - *then it would seem the server is responding
as it should* - and the test needs correction. Otherwise - some help with
moving forward is appreciated!

    <tt>Moving this to a thread with a better title!<br>
      <br>
      A longish read - basically while 2.4.12 had few errors when built
      against OpenSSL 0.9.8 LibreSSL has quite a few errors - perhaps
      because it has removed many "unsafe" crypto combinations. The root
      question is: is this LibreSSL misbehaving, or are the tests
      needing some work to verify that "weak ciphers and key exchanges
      are not being used - e.g., via renegotiation. <br>
      <br>
      +++<br>
    </tt>
    <pre wrap="">I wish to recall a pleasant get together last April in Texas just before
ApacheCon. At that time I mentioned LibreSSL and building httpd against it
(actually mod_ssl is all it amounts to).

The build itself was quite simple - I shall repeat that now for 2.4.16 and
trunk - and send the 'patch' in.

While build is simple - understanding the differences in test output is
daunting.

Here I have the output of just one test t/ssl/pr12355.t - and note the
differences in the ssl_access_log - not just the error messages (I have
removed all "debug" messages from the logs as they were "in the way".

LibreSSL is version 2.2.0, OpenSSL is version 0.9.8m (yes I know very old,
will test with latest patches later - I hope not relevant to here).

So, please note: LibreSSL says access is:
t/logs/ssl_request_log:[16/Jul/2015:11:47:12 +0000] 127.0.0.1 - - "POST
/require-sha-cgi/perl_echo.pl HTTP/1.1" 403 237
while OpenSSL says
t/logs/ssl_request_log:[16/Jul/2015:11:32:35 +0000] 127.0.0.1 TLSv1 RC4-SHA
"POST /require-sha-cgi/perl_echo.pl HTTP/1.1" 200 11

My question: what can I do to understand why OpenSSL is adding TLSv1
RC4-SHA while LibreSSL is "- -"

<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Observation<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>: I am guessing the test is failing because the renegotiation
is failing because it is downgrading to "(near) export quality" - which
many recent CVE are reporting as "very bad".
Maybe, this fail is a false "FAIL" - that 0.9.8 will always PASS because
that is what 0.9.8 does.

<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Last question<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>: IF you think this failure is because the renegotiation is
requesting something is bad - *then it would seem the server is responding
as it should* - and the test needs correction. Otherwise - some help with
moving forward is appreciated!</pre>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

With 4/5 of the 2.2.30 voters having re-reviewed 2.2.31, and the single
s/-1/+1/ based on this re-roll, I'm confident in calling this vote a
success,
and am pushing this release to the mirrors for announcement tomorrow.

Thanks all for all the reviews of both 2.2 candidates (and all of the 4 2.4
candidates!) that you were able to participate in, seemed unusually
difficult
to make it this far, but here we are at last.

Yours,

Bill

I'll take this one item.  Take a look into our implementation of
ssl_var_lookup_ssl

any meaningful data to represent.

LibreSSL is version 2.2.0, OpenSSL is version 0.9.8m (yes I know very old,

LibreSSL is version 2.2.0, OpenSSL is version 0.9.8m (yes I know very old,

Latest commit on test framework ([1]) replaced RC4-{MD5,SHA} with
AES{128,256}-SHA so that these are more likely to be known by both
libs (unless LibreSSL also disabled all CBC based chainings).
So if RC4 was the culprit, the tests (pr12355 and pr43738) should pass now.

BTW that's not what triggers the renegotiations since keep-alive seems
not be used for successive requests (that possibly could be another
test, though logs show Initial connections only here), but rather a
specific Location's CipherSuite different from the (handshaken)
VirtualHost's one.

Is the framework using openssl or libressl here?
Are PATH or APACHE_TEST_OPENSSL_CMD defined, or maybe the system's default lib?

That's not an alert (a close?).
Maybe a higher LogLevel (trace5?) would help, and/or a pcap...

so if I look through the VirtualHost definitions made by ApacheTest I 
should see some "Location CipherSuite" declarations?

As it is TLSv1.2 - that is LibreSSL. I'll generate a list of the ciphers 
it supports asap.

I had cut out all the debug statements - (grep -v debug 
t/logs/error_log) - for me too much noise.
I'll see about pcap/tcpdump (AIX program name is either tcpdump

I have two different servers (x065 - OpenSSL, x068 - LibreSSL) - and I 
have not done anything 'special' with either PATH or APACHE_TEST_OPENSSL_CMD

I did have to repackage apr-util-1.5.4 so that it also knew about LibreSSL

openssl versions: initally with
root@x064:[/]openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.8k 25 Mar 2009

Later updated to:

root@x065:[/]openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013

And also patched with latest ifixes (not on atm).

Cipher List for OpenSSL - as you would expect for OpenSSL 0.9.8 (25 entries)

LibreSSL has many more ciphers, none of SSLv2 - and it does have RC4-MD5 
so that could not have been the problem - root cause.

I assume the attached logs_pr12355_LibreSSL.zip was with the latest
framework (including r1691419), so the RC4 => AES changes did not
work...

Yes, t/conf/ssl/ssl.conf.in has a VirtualHost SSLCipherSuite
"ALL:!ADH:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL" which is
overridden for some <Location>s (/require-aes{128,256}-cgi and
/modules/ssl/aes{128,256}/) with SSLCipherSuite "AES{128,256}-SHA".

Ouch, quite hard to read TLS in the matrix :)
Maybe "tcpdump -i lo -w dump.pcap -s0 tcp port 8532"?
(dump.pcap would then be readable in wireshark).

But possibly "LogLevel trace5" in httpd.conf (or
t/conf/ssl/ssl.conf.in 's VirtualHost) would be enough to see what's
going on.

Since the "error" (interruption) seems to be on the client side
though, it may also be interesting to start httpd with a configuration
like the framework's generated t/conf/ssl/ssl.conf file, and then use
openssl s_client (or libressl s_client? dunno the name of that binary
in libreSSL...) with -state and -debug to have the client's POV...

Yes, that was with the latest framework (svn checkout) - as I showed in 
the ciphers list - it is still there.

I would expect wireshark can also read iptrace date (the .iptrc file in 
the bz2 attachment)

Easiest for testing to just set it in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf and run make 
test again. This server is only for testing anyway.

libressl is the name of the package. the commands, etc. are the same. 
So, if you can be more explicit about what you are thinking/needing I 
shall comply.

p.s. I have built 2.4.16 now - and did not have to change anything for 
it to build against LibreSSL (very small ifdefs were needed with 2.4.12).
And the summary of ApacheTest is now:

Would you prefer a different test (rather than pr12355.t - that was just 
first in the list)?

I checked out the test framework from  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/test/framework/trunk, followed the README and ran the tests against a freshly installed 2.4.x in /opt/httpd/2.4-plain. It did PASS with the default httpd.conf, but many tests were skipped due to modules missing.

What I have done - using a MUCH older version of perl is the following:

# perl -MCPAN -e shell

And once configured to get sources,

install Bundle::ApacheTest

You may run into other issues you need to resolve before the Bundle 
installs successfully.

Hope this helps!

Here you had provided the answer that had been starting at me in the 
README file. Not being an avid perl programmer it did not ring a bell 
right away.

perhaps add
HTTP::DAV

There are still some tests that get skipped, e.g.
t/apache/pr17629.t .................. skipped: cannot find module 
'deflate', cannot find module 'case_filter'

is deflate and/or case_filter:  IO::Compress::Deflate 
(P/PM/PMQS/IO-Compress-2.068.tar.gz)? or Compress::Deflate7 
(B/BJ/BJOERN/Compress-Deflate7-1.0.tar.gz) or ???

although...
cpan> install IO::Compress::Deflate
IO::Compress::Deflate is up to date.

so, using i/deflate/ is not helping me (enough).

No, it's the loaded Apache modules by those names.

Thanks, I finally managed to build libressl on my system and
httpd-2.4.x linked to it.
However since this isn't the system's native libssl, the perl
framework (libwww-perl/5.836 here) does not use it (but Debian's
libssl-0.9.8o-4squeeze20), so I had to use libressl's "openssl
s_client" to reproduce the case.

So:
$ /path/to/httpd/2.4.x/bin/httpd -f
/path/to/httpd/framework/trunk/t/conf/httpd.conf -X
on the server side, and:
$ /path/to/libressl/2.2.1/bin/openssl s_client -connect localhost:8532 -state
on the client side, with this simple request:
GET /require-aes128-cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8532

Attached are the logs from both httpd and s_client, where we can see
that httpd somehow expects a client certificate during the
renegotiation (without sending any certificate request...), while
s_client obviously does not send anything like that (but its key
exchange).

I can't explain that... I'd need to debug.
Does this ring someone's bell?

Sure.  AIUI, LibreSSL stripped out TLS renegotiation as an 'unsafe thing'.

Some of our tests demonstrate per-dir renegotiation for stricter SSL
ciphers or client certs in specific contexts, but this would not be
a supported feature under LibreSSL if I understood their scope changes
correctly.  The test is right, IMHO.

I installed a virgin system without OpenSSL, installed LibreSSL and then 
installed Bundle::ApacheTest - which loaded (compiled against libressl) 
the SSL related modules into perl on AIX.

I repeated the same steps on a second AIX - installing only OpenSSL and 
then installing Bundle::ApacheTest

I will try and repeat what you did as well.

    Not knowing much - how much of a hint is it that there are
    references to SSLv3 (aka TLSv1.0) while the initial connection is
    TLSv1.2?<br>
    <br>
    Do the SSL Library numbers indicate where to look?<br>

I used the port defined for the SSL VirtualHost in
/path/to/httpd/framework/trunk/t/conf/ssl/ssl.conf (i.e. I ran httpd
directly with the configuration files generated by the framework).

That port may be determined the first time the tests are run though,
so you probably have to look at this VirtualHost's definition in your
environment...

Here I can see:
    <VirtualHost _default_:8532>

So, did you run
/path/to/httpd -f `pwd`/t/conf/httpd.conf -X

or

/path/to/httpd -f `pwd`t/conf/ssl/ssl.conf -X

I tried to follow your's literally (I thought).

Subject: Injecting HTTP request without using standard socket
From: Phil Lello <phil@dunlop-lello.uk>

Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=001a114753325212de051b18d0ec

Hi all,

I'm currently developing a pseudo-VPN service, and would like to be able to
inject requests (and process responses) without going through the stock
HTTP/HTTPS endpoints.

Is this possible purely as a module, or would I need to have a custom
HTTPD? I think this touches on the proxy enhancements which I believe are
on this list.

What I'm trying to achieve at the pseudo-VPN layer is server selection
based on purely the first line of the HTTP request, or in the case of
HTTPS, by picking a server from SNI. I want to prefix a small header
(probably just the sockaddr struct) on requests coming out of the VPN, then
send that plus the request payload on to apache. This will then be used to
set the REMOTE_HOST. X-Forwarded-For isn't an option as I want to pass
encrypted traffic on for processing by the normal httpd code.

I am considering using one of UNIX-domain sockets, TCP/IP sockets, or an
API binding to the VPN as the transport layer for requests, so want to
inject packets/consume responses somewhere just after the normal apache
listen, once the REMOTE_HOST has been decoded.

Thanks for any pointers on this - I'm currently too buried in the VPN code
to learn the HTTPD API at the moment, but want get an idea for if my
current architecture can work the way I want - I'm also trying to avoid
taking on more code maintenance that I need to.

Phil

My understanding:

ssl_engine_kernel.c(1841): [client 127.0.0.1:39154] AH02041: Protocol: 
TLSv1, Cipher: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA (256/256 bits)
is more strict/secure than

ssl_engine_kernel.c(1841): [client 127.0.0.1:39154] AH02041: Protocol: 
TLSv1, Cipher: RC4-SHA (128/128 bits)

(The cipher used in the test has been upgraded since, but still at 128 
bits if I recall correctly).

If I understand your comment "

"Some of our tests demonstrate per-dir renegotiation for stricter SSL
ciphers or client certs in specific contexts"

This does not appear to me to be what is being tested now. I think the 
test need to start, somehow, at - let's say 128-bit- but goes to 256 bit 
when a different directory is requested.

More in general though - trying to think as OpenBSD might have been 
thinking re:
"Stricter SSL ciphers than original" connection.

I had the assumption (which is always dangerous)
that default behavior of servers and clients was to negotiate the 
strictest combination that
both supported. Key phrase: "assume default behavior".

I do not memorize CVE numbers, or even text - but renegotiate DOWN has 
become popular to attempt to lessen (break) security - such as logjam -

 From https://access.redhat.com/articles/1456263
in which a man-in-the-middle attacker could downgrade vulnerable TLS 
connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. The attack affects any 
server that supports DHE_EXPORT ciphers. This attack can be conduted by 
pre-computation of the 512-bit primes given in two popular sets of weak 
Diffie-Hellman parameters, namely Apache's /httpd/ versions 2.1.5 to 
2.4.7, and all versions of OpenSSL.

 From above quote it seems that this has already been addressed in 2.4.8 
and later, and maybe even in the 2.2.31 - but it "feels" as if the 
LibreSSL approach (no renegotiate) cuts off a line of attack - and, 
properly configured - a client-server should always be connecting at the 
most secure cipher possible.

Special situations:
"Beliefs" - the server should always determine the minimum level of 
ciphers "acceptable", and the highest that the client says to support 
should be used. There should never be a reason to go to a lower quality 
- hence, renegotiation at the request of the client should never be 
accepted.
* Should the server determine that for a specific "Location"/"Directory" 
more strict levels
are needed then a new handshake (renegotiate if you prefer) for a 
stricter cipher should start. However, based on the assumption above 
(the strictest cipher that the client has is already being used) - this 
should always fail because the client is not already at that level.

Attached are the logs from both httpd and s_client, where we can see
that httpd somehow expects a client certificate during the
renegotiation (without sending any certificate request...), while
s_client obviously does not send anything like that (but its key
exchange).

I can't explain that... I'd need to debug.

Sure.  AIUI, LibreSSL stripped out TLS renegotiation as an 'unsafe thing'.

Some of our tests demonstrate per-dir renegotiation for stricter SSL
ciphers or client certs in specific contexts, but this would not be
a supported feature under LibreSSL if I understood their scope changes
correctly.  The test is right, IMHO.</pre>

The assumption is not right.  The servers list and the clients list
are in an arbitrary order decided by whoever wrote and configured the
software, and the server can choose to honor either (or neither, but
that would be weird) ordering.  Also, some ciphers do not have such a
strict relative ordering of strength.

That is the problem with 'assumptions' of course. Assumptions are 
frequently wrong.
By specifying "defaults" I was hoping that httpd defaults would 
behave/order from highest to lowest - however, it seems OpenSSL never 
came up with a good naming scheme of "better" to worse. The closest you 
can get to a listing of defaults (I read elsewhere) is the output of the 
command "openssl ciphers -v"

 a simple way to set minimum levels in "core"?

A) OpenSSL and LibreSSL behave differently. Not surprising, because 
LibreSSL got it's start because OpenBSD was (my words) - fed up - with 
the upkeep of OpenSSL. And there are several presentations of "the first 
30 days of LibreSSL" where the focus was on cutting out anything they 
felt was inherently insecure (keeping calls for "linking", but having 
them be a no-op).

B) Maybe for a long time - 'attackers' have been targeting weaknesses in 
the OpenSSL specification (e.g. arbitrary order decidedfor ciphers, kex, 
etc.). Since HeartBleed and POODLE there is, in any case, a lot more 
attention to these issues.

My (humble) opinion: for something as important to society - as httpd is 
these days - httpd should do (and maybe you have already!) to make sure 
that "any client" cannot break a server, or force into low modes of 
encryption. "The server should decide" and the defaults should be higher 
than they are now - even if it be arranged by a "simple change" (I would 
hope) to httpd.conf where a configuration line is added to force 
"TLS1.2" as minimum encryption - should it be used.

p.s. - my goal is to start a discussion - if this is not the right place 
- "kick me", and I shall look for a better venue.

regards,
Michael

This was addressed for 2.2.31 and 2.4.16... See the significantly revised
default docs/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf.in template for our recommended
config.

We won't be entertaining patches to change the compiled-in behavior in
these maintenance branches, this has severely negative impacts on users
updating to the same version major.minor for security updates on an
expedited basis.

Our discussions of compiled-in behavior changes is limited to svn trunk
(what will become httpd 2.6 or 3.0).

Much of this discussion becomes mute in the coming year or few as users
deploy OpenSSL, LibreSSL or GNUTLS with all legacy SSLv3 and TLSv1.0
support eliminated.

Subject: Supporting non-TCP/IP transports

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hi all,

I'm looking at patching httpd/libapr to support non-TCP transports.

Specifically, the transports I'd like add are:

- UNIX-domain sockets
- File-system pipes (and pipe-like devices - e.g. serial ports)

Would there be interest in adding these to core?

Phil

I personally think this could be very useful. However I am mainly a lurker 
here so assign the appropriate weight to that opinion.

Thanks for the heads up. After further digging, I believe it's not
really comparable to the cases you're probably referring to (only found
these two):

1) ERR_load_crypto_strings() / ERR_free_strings()

Originally addressed in https://svn.apache.org/r101624, it was
subsequently fixed in OpenSSL (0.9.8e and later, see [1]), and
in late 2014 also adjusted for more recent OpenSSL versions
(PR 53435 / https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53435).

2) CRYPTO_new_ex_data() / CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data()

Addressed in https://svn.apache.org/r654119 (by dropping the
CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data call), see also PR 44975 /
https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44975).

OBJ_create() / OBJ_cleanup() doesn't seem to suffer from these problems,
but on the other hand, I'm also fine with dropping the OBJ_cleanup()
call, since we only call OBJ_create() if the table entry doesn't exist
yet (i.e. even repeated calls in ssl_init_Module / reloads
do not cause any "leak").

> There is some complicated interaction between EVP_cleanup() and
> OBJ_cleanup() which I haven't tried to decipher, but it looks like
> EVP_cleanup() will actually do the cleanup call?

This was added with 1.0.0, apparently [2]. The code would apply if
OBJ_cleanup were called *before* EVP_cleanup (in all other cases,
EVP_cleanup does not call OBJ_cleanup).

But, to be on the safe side, I think we could a) move the OBJ_create()
call to ssl_hook_pre_config and b) omit OBJ_cleanup(). Do you concur?

I am "behind the times" obviously here.

I have some regular work to do, but I shall try adopting the settings in 
httpd-ssl.conf and see if it has any effect on the tests when using 
OpenSSL. Ideally, I will be able to set "my defaults" so that a test 
with a CipherSuite setting that is lower that I want to serve - as a 
server - will also 'FAIL' because the renegotiation is not permitted "by 
me".

I was not expecting anything "compiled-in", why I was thinking 
httpd.conf to "literally" put in a place that cannot be avoided rather 
than somewhere someone should be looking (like asking people to read the 
manual :) )

Yes, this is also what got me digging - the absolute demand that
a) system already running TLS1.0 are permissable but must come up with a 
change plan
b) systems not running TLS1.2 must do so by 1 July 2016
c) all new systems MUST use TLS1.2 from the start.

(paraphrased from memory, so I hope I have the key points correct!)

Many thanks for your reply!

Well, right now httpd (in 2.4) can proxy over UDS... I have
been thinking about adding UDS support to Listen as well.

X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.2102)

I made a proposal for the "Protocols" extensions that allows various =
modules
participate in protocol negotiation without specific knowledge of the =
exact
mechanism involved.

Since this is unreadable as mail and the Apache wiki login was no =
cooperating,
I made a page here: https://icing.github.io/mod_h2/protocols.html

Key points:
- Integrates TLS+ALPN and HTTP/1 Upgrade: header
- Allows upgrades on "clean" connection and in the middle of a request. =
Implementors might chose to only support one or the other or both
- Protocol implementers can have a late veto via callback

Feedback really appreciated.

Looks reasonable here, maybe need some clarification on when a
protocol may be registered (post_config?).

Also, I am curious if ap_protocol_select needs to really be an API.
Who calls it in the current h2 case?

Correct. That is necessary.

Ignore my last post - presumably UDS is short for UNIX-domain socket!

If we are going down a plugable protocol route, that I'd like to see the
option to use something a lot more complicated that a socket - e.g. a
connection to a remote SSHD / socket forward via libssh or similar.

Someone reported that 2.2.31 (w/ mod_ssl) doesn't build under FreeBSD 10:

Hmm, I don't see the line numbers of ssl_engine_dh.c in the the log matching with the ones of 2.2.31.
And the log says somewhere above:

Applying FreeBSD patches for apache22-2.2.31

Maybe a faulty patch to ssl_engine_dh.c that changed the DH code for FreeBSD before 2.2.31?

Regards

Rdiger

It seems

http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/www/apache22/

is still at 2.2.29 and people are working on it. Under "files" there are 
several mod_ssl patches, including changes to DH code, so like Rüdiger I 
expect they have to adjust or drop some of these patches.

Rainer

Subject: mod_ssl: How to react on default OpenSSL SSL_CTX_set_options?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.68 on 10.5.11.26

Hi,

in Fedora, OpenSSL maintainers are setting SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 and 
SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 options by default [1].

This disables both SSLv2 and SSLv3 by default in the SSLv23_method(), 
which is what mod_ssl uses when more than one version is requested.

The side effect of this change in OpenSSL is that some configurations 
that attempt to explicitly enable SSLv3 don't work correctly.  While 
this enables SSLv3, as it uses SSLv3_method:

SSLProtocol +SSLv3

the following two do not work:

SSLProtocol +SSLv3 +TLSv1
SSLProtocol all -TLSv1.1 -TLSv1.2

We have following options now:

1. Clear the SSL_OP_NO_SSLvX flags when there is "+SSLvX". It means 
doing something like:

if (!(protocol & SSL_PROTOCOL_SSLV3)) {
     SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3);
} else {
     SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3);
}

That overwrites the defaults set by the OpenSSL.

2. Same as 1., but print a warning we are overwriting the system OpenSSL 
settings.

3. Respect the defaults set by OpenSSL and print a warning, that we 
won't overwrite it. That's probably silly if you really want to enable 
SSLv3 just in httpd.


[1] http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/commit/?id=80b5477

What would you choose? Or should that be handled differently?

Regards,
Jan Kaluza

I've tried some later versions of Perl (like 5.20 and 5.22) and
I get really strange errors... like byterange.t simply hanging.
I also had some issues on a setup which had Perl 5.16 but with
all CPAN modules upgraded.

Is there some recommended version of Perl to use...

Would modssl_register_alpn() remain per-connection?  If you're on the
fence at all -- I am working with a less flexible SSL toolkit whose
ALPN advertisement is equivalent to server-level and not
per-connection callback oriented.

Hmmm... this is weird. The errors and hangs only seem to occur
if Protocol::HTTP2 and AnyEvent are added...

Hmmm Wondering if this is due to:

   Test::TCP [build_requires]

Anyway, this is on OSX, fwiw.

What system are you testing on...?

I'm able to get CentOS6 running, but it fails w/ tests 17 and 18 on h2

On OSX, like I said, I can't even get past the byterange*.t tests

My OS X setup, may it help find the cause of problems:

- httpd/trunk built with prefix/opt/apachte-trunk
  with --*really*-build-and-load-all-modules and then
  all but one mpm commented out
- test/framework/trunk build with /opt/apache-trunk/bin/apxs
  all extra modules installed/updated with perl -MCPAN -e 'install XXX'
- Test configuration called with
   PATH=3D/opt/apache-trunk/bin/:$PATH t/TEST=20
  as it needs to find the correct openssl binary
- test suite result is PASS

I have been installing Bundle::ApacheTest on AIX 5.3, with perl-5.8.2 and
the tests seem to be working normally for me.

There have been some "//" comment errors pop-up in a few mods, and a define
that AIX does not like with a few mods. But other than those typos the only
problem I have had is with getting SSLeay to keep working after updating
OpenSSL. rebuilding the modules after game changing updates seems to clear
errors.

Two reasons for this:
1. the post_select should run for all before anything happens
2. switch on Upgrade headers must be handled immediately by a hook as the se=
rver has just send the 101 and the switch must write the response in the new=
 protocol.=

Ok, so the first (hook ordering) registered module and "aware" of the
new protocol would handle it?
Maybe could we rather do that in the post_select hook (RUN_FIRST), and
prevent any other/later module from thinking it could be the one?

[note crosspost and followup-to]

With the coming of mod_h2 and talk of EOL for 2.2,
my modules book is getting a bit long in the tooth.
Is it time for either a new edition or a new
dev-oriented book?

I'm not about to motivate myself to the level that
got my modules book onto the shelves.  But if there's
sufficient interest, I'd certainly play my part in
a multi-author effort, and offer to coordinate it
if noone else wants to take the lead.

In the case of a multi-author second edition to my book,
I think I'd contractually have to offer first refusal
to Prentice Hall, and I'd suggest making any royalties
payable to the ASF.  In the case of an entirely new work,
there'd be no such strings attached, but it would
probably be inappropriate for me to take a coordinating
role or to contribute material from the old book.

Anyone interested?

I think this is related to

Bug https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58118

Whereas the 503-logging has been fixed, the verbose error logging is 
still an issue in 2.4.16 (I planned to report this).

Speaking for modules/proxy/mod_proxy_fcgi.c, lowering the log level in 
line 836  to something like debug or trace1 (I'm not familiar with the 
policy or formality of loglevels in Apache httpd) should help.

It would be even better to log only conditionally (in line 848 just 
before the HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE retval), since at this point we can 
exclude any return value from dispatch that is not due to the client 
closing the connection or sending a bad request.

Should I propose a patch?

Kind regards,
Tobias Adolph

In best programmers' tradition, I just made a large commit just before =
my vacation...In good Apache tradition, however, I ran all regression =
tests with it. So, hopefully this works for you as well, otherwise, =
please just revert the commit and curse my name.

CAVEAT: this commit changes mod_ssl and core_config structures. A "make =
clean" is recommended. As the core API was extended, you might also have =
to delete installed header files.

The new directive "Protocols" is implemented for server and vhosts. =
Example

  Protocols http/1.1 h2             #supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 (when =
over TLS) and prefers to talk HTTP/1.

  Protocols h2 spdy/3.1 http/1.1    #HTTP/2 is preferred over spdy with =
HTTP/1.1 coming last.

When no "Protocols" are specified, all protocols implemented in the =
server can be negotiated. Protocols from a base server are additive. The =
ALPN negotiated now calls the new core APIs which can be found in =
http_protocol.h (seemed the most suitable place).

Registration is done in three hooks. An implementation can be seen in =
h2_switch.c

Missing:
- Directive documentation (My excuse is that it will change after =
feedback+discussion anyway)
- Ordering directive - not sure if we need it. I will ask the browser =
implementors on the HTTP workshop on Monday what their requirements are

Discussion:
- Is the default for "Protocols" what we want?
- Is the additive nature of "Protocols" what we want?
- Is this the right abstraction? I tried to make it general enough that =
other mechanisms may use the same API and other protocols find it easy =
to register. Nevertheless, once cannot foresee the future and what =
requirements come up. My overall impression is that the code is smaller =
and cleaner now. mod_h2's pre-connection hook with registration became =
unnecessary.

Cheers,

  Stefan

The c->keepalive = AP_CONN_CLOSE looks fine to me, but why should we do the other stuff in a handler.
IMHO that should be done by the existing code.

Why do we need to handle upgrades on OPTIONS requests?

Not sure I understand. You mean the interim response or the whole =

There are clients that try Upgrade: h2c on OPTIONS * before a POST. As =
upgrades on requests with bodies are not implemented (agreement by =
several implememtors on the http wg mailing list).

If not in APR it should probably be put into util.c and made ap_array_index.
Once in APR it could be converted into a wrapper macro around the APR function.

Hi,
The NetWare Gurus seem to be on holidays. For your consideration:

Subject: Apache-Test, httpd-2.2.31 - help with debug/understanding t/ssl related
 error_log requested
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have built, and "tested" httpd-2.2.31 - and while 2.4.16 has no 
errors, 2.2.31 reports some errors.
I have tried to understand the error_log, but I am not making any sense 
of the output.

This is using OpenSSL. Same errors, and basically same error_log output 
regardless of linked against OpenSSL-0.9.8.so or OpenSSL-1.0.0.so (i.e., 
the same tests fail).

FYI: I have also tested against LibreSSL and get many more messages. And 
the good news is that there were many more failed tests with version 
2.2.29 - so version 2.2.31 has corrected many t/ssl errors compared to 
2.2.29

Suggestions/Hints on how to proceed welcome (read requested).

Procedure used:
First ran "t/TEST t/ssl" to get the general results (see Extra info below)
then: the following sequence

t/TEST -start-httpd
# clear the logs
for i in access_log error_log rewrite_log 
ssl_request_log^Jdo^J>t/logs/$i^Jdone
t/TEST t/ssl/extlookup.t
cp -rp t/logs 2.2.31/extlookup.t.logs

for i in access_log error_log rewrite_log 
ssl_request_log^Jdo^J>t/logs/$i^Jdone
t/TEST t/ssl/require.t
cp -rp t/logs 2.2.31/require.t.logs

t/TEST -stop-httpd
END of procedure...

** Comments/Current Thoughts **
re: "REQUIRE"
a) I do not understand why the "require" test even has the Failed 
expression (cannot find "Lemons", as it is not in the require.t test - 
but is part of the text for in the test extlookup.t

b) I am guessing this is not the failing test in the require.t test ...

in the error_log (i.e., a late flush of a log?)?

Subject: revisiting instdso.sh reported bugs - after nearly 8 years - maybe
 actually patch instdso.sh ??
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Over the years (2007 being the first time for me) there have been at 
least three bugs reported re: instdso.sh - two on PHP - which they 
closed as not a PHP bug, and one on the apache bug list.
1. https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=27795
2. https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=43032
3. https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43012

Further, I started a mail discussion here as well 
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/201405.mbox/ See 
message titled:Subject Unhappy interactions between AIX, apxs, 
instdso.sh, apr/build-1/libtool and php

Today I started repackaging php again (I lost my previous archive during 
a NAS update. User error, snif) - and this brought me back to this problem.

The patch I am using is:

And I would be very happy - after 8 years of waiting - if instdso.sh could be patched.
Feel free to delete my comments about hoping TARGET_NAME is in .libs

p.s. Something "nice", but optional
* the patch above fixes the regular make install command - however, when working with
INSTALL_ROOT (the php equivalent of using DESTDIR) - the update of httpd.conf to add
the module basically always fails. Rather than exit with non-zero status - only giving
a warning message would be nicer - so the "DESTDIR" aka INSTALL_ROOT install finishes.

Currently I am getting:
+ make install DESTDIR=/var/aixtools/prj/php/5.2.17.0>  .buildaix/install.out

I can almost get the same using "make -i install"

Hello,

I've been reviewing the open bugs for mod_session and am interesting in 
contributing patches for some of them. But I couldn't find any tests for 
mod_session in httpd-test to verify changes and avoid regressions.

So I filed a bug report with a patch that includes some functional tests 
for mod_session. I couldn't find too many similar patches, but hopefully 
this is the correct way to go about it.

https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58172

Thank you for your time!

Thank you for reviewing and committing those tests so quickly! I think 
the test_session directory is missing the svn:ignore prop:

$ svn propget svn:ignore c-modules/test_session
$ svn propget svn:ignore c-modules/test_ssl
Makefile
.libs
*.lo
*.slo
*.la
*.so
*.exp
*.lib

If you have ever read the httpd doccos, there are many people who
made them what they are, and are deserving of thanks. But today we
have lost one of the main and core talents behind them.

N=C3=B3ir=C3=ADn was a bright light and a festive soul; they were =
talented
and humble, with a passion tempered by joy and love. Their life
had many highs, and some crushing lows, but N=C3=B3ir=C3=ADn was always =
open
and listened to their heart.

I will miss N=C3=B3ir=C3=ADn. We all will.=

Anyone have a contact at ohloh/openhub/blackduck?  HTTP Server somehow
lost all of its users (well, we have 1 user now), which takes us off
the front page.

Anyone have an informal contact?

Hi Eric, no ownership/membership issues right now...

I think you are following the wrong project (its not 'httpd') or this has
more
to do with their site falling over? The app seems unresponsive.

https://www.openhub.net/p/apache

You are still a manager.
